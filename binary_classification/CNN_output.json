That time, the world came together", "time": "17 min ago", "author": "From Paul French for CNN", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-04-19-20-intl/index.html", "content": "In 1911, a deadly epidemic spread through China and threatened to become a pandemic. Its origins appeared to be related to the trade in wild animals, but at the time no one was sure.'Lockdowns, quarantine measures, the wearing of masks, travel restrictions, the mass cremation of victims, and border controls were deployed to try to lower the infection rate. Yet more than 60,000 people died in modern-day northeast China, making it one of the world's largest epidemics at the time.'When the disease was eventually brought under control, the Chinese government convened the International Plague Conference in the northern'city of Shenyang -- close to the epicenter of the outbreak.'In attendance were virologists, bacteriologists, epidemiologists and disease experts from many of the world's major powers -- the United States, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom and France.The purpose of the conference:  Experts wanted to find the cause of the outbreak, learn which suppression techniques were most effective, discover why the disease had spread so far so fast, and assess what could be done to prevent a second wave. Learning the lessons: As the world faces a pandemic characterized by a lack of a globally co-ordinated response and multilateral effort on the part of political leaders, the collaborative aspects of the 1911 conference in China are worth reconsidering.Read more about the Great Manchurian Plague and global responses to it here:"}

What happened?", "time": "1 hr 14 min ago", "author": "Analysis from CNN's'James Griffiths", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-04-19-20-intl/index.html", "content": "Less than a month ago, Singapore was'being hailed'as one of the countries that had got its'coronavirus response'right.'Encouragingly for the rest of the world, the city-state seemed to have suppressed cases without imposing the restrictive lockdown measures endured by millions elsewhere.And then the second wave hit, hard. Since March 17, Singapore's number of confirmed coronavirus cases grew from 266 to over 5,900,'according to data from Johns Hopkins University.'So what went wrong?'Migrant workers: The answer appears to lie in overlooked clusters of cases among migrant workers living in cramped dormitories and an underestimation of the speed at which those infections could spread through a city where lockdown measures had not been put in place.Life as normal: Because Singapore was testing widely and isolating all those who were potentially contagious, it was able to remain relatively open and continue functioning as usual. This attitude was only viable if infections from overseas were kept out, and new potential cases were detected and dealt with quickly.Rapid spread: Once this measure failed, the speed at which the virus could pass from person to person was greater than it would be in a place with heavy lockdown and social distancing measures.For more on how Singapore's experience shows relaxing too soon can backfire, read here:"}
