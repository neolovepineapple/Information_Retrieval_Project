The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will update this guidance as needed and as additional information becomes available. Please check the CDC website periodically for updated interim guidance. This document provides interim guidance specific for correctional facilities and detention centers during the outbreak of COVID-19, to ensure continuation of essential public services and protection of the health and safety of incarcerated and detained persons, staff, and visitors. Recommendations may need to be revised as more information becomes available. Who is the intended audience for this guidance? This document is intended to provide guiding principles for healthcare and non-healthcare administrators of correctional and detention facilities (including but not limited to federal and state prisons, local jails, and detention centers), law enforcement agencies that have custodial authority for detained populations (i.e., US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and US Marshals Service), and their respective health departments, to assist in preparing for potential introduction, spread, and mitigation of COVID-19 in their facilities. In general, the document uses terminology referring to correctional environments but can also be applied to civil and pre-trial detention settings. This guidance will not necessarily address every possible custodial setting and may not use legal terminology specific to individual agencies\u2019 authorities or processes. The guidance may need to be adapted based on individual facilities\u2019 physical space, staffing, population, operations, and other resources and conditions. Facilities should contact CDC or their state, local, territorial, and/or tribal public health department if they need assistance in applying these principles or addressing topics that are not specifically covered in this guidance. Why is this guidance being issued? Correctional and detention facilities can include custody, housing, education, recreation, healthcare, food service, and workplace components in a single physical setting. The integration of these components presents unique challenges for control of COVID-19 transmission among incarcerated/detained persons, staff, and visitors. Consistent application of specific preparation, prevention, and management measures can help reduce the risk of transmission and severe disease from COVID-19. Incarcerated/detained persons live, work, eat, study, and recreate within congregate environments, heightening the potential for COVID-19 to spread once introduced. In most cases, incarcerated/detained persons are not permitted to leave the facility. There are many opportunities for COVID-19 to be introduced into a correctional or detention facility, including daily staff ingress and egress; transfer of incarcerated/detained persons between facilities and systems, to court appearances, and to outside medical visits; and visits from family, legal representatives, and other community members. Some settings, particularly jails and detention centers, have high turnover, admitting new entrants daily who may have been exposed to COVID-19 in the surrounding community or other regions. Persons incarcerated/detained in a particular facility often come from a variety of locations, increasing the potential to introduce COVID-19 from different geographic areas. Options for medical isolation of COVID-19 cases are limited and vary depending on the type and size of facility, as well as the current level of available capacity, which is partly based on medical isolation needs for other conditions. Adequate levels of custody and healthcare staffing must be maintained to ensure safe operation of the facility, and options to practice social distancing through work alternatives such as working from home or reduced/alternate schedules are limited for many staff roles. Correctional and detention facilities can be complex, multi-employer settings that include government and private employers. Each is organizationally distinct and responsible for its own operational, personnel, and occupational health protocols and may be prohibited from issuing guidance or providing services to other employers or their staff within the same setting. Similarly, correctional and detention facilities may house individuals from multiple law enforcement agencies or jurisdictions subject to different policies and procedures. Incarcerated/detained persons and staff may have medical conditions that increase their risk of severe disease from COVID-19. Because limited outside information is available to many incarcerated/detained persons, unease and misinformation regarding the potential for COVID-19 spread may be high, potentially creating security and morale challenges. The ability of incarcerated/detained persons to exercise disease prevention measures (e.g., frequent handwashing) may be limited and is determined by the supplies provided in the facility and by security considerations. Many facilities restrict access to soap and paper towels and prohibit alcohol-based hand sanitizer and many disinfectants. Incarcerated persons may hesitate to report symptoms of COVID-19 or seek medical care due to co-pay requirements and fear of isolation. CDC has issued separate COVID-19 guidance addressing healthcare infection control\u00a0and clinical care of COVID-19 cases as well as close contacts of cases\u00a0in community-based settings. Where relevant, community-focused guidance documents are referenced in this document and should be monitored regularly for updates, but they may require adaptation for correctional and detention settings. This guidance document provides additional recommended best practices specifically for correctional and detention facilities. At this time, different facility types (e.g., prison vs. jail) and sizes are not differentiated. Administrators and agencies should adapt these guiding principles to the specific needs of their facility. What topics does this guidance include? The guidance below includes detailed recommendations on the following topics related to COVID-19 in correctional and detention settings: Operational and communications preparations for COVID-19 Enhanced cleaning/disinfecting and hygiene practices Social distancing strategies to increase space between individuals in the facility How to limit transmission from visitors Infection control, including recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) and potential alternatives during PPE shortages Verbal screening and temperature check protocols for incoming incarcerated/detained individuals, staff, and visitors Medical isolation of confirmed and suspected cases and quarantine of contacts, including considerations for cohorting when individual spaces are limited Healthcare evaluation for suspected cases, including testing for COVID-19 Clinical care for confirmed and suspected cases Considerations for persons at higher risk of severe disease from COVID-19 Definitions of Commonly Used Terms Close contact of a COVID-19 case \u2013 In the context of COVID-19, an individual is considered a close contact if they a) have been within approximately 6 feet of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time or b) have had direct contact with infectious secretions from a COVID-19 case (e.g., have been coughed on). Close contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a common space with a COVID-19 case. Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited. Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure risk, as does exposure to a severely ill patient). Cohorting \u2013 Cohorting refers to the practice of isolating multiple laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases together as a group, or quarantining close contacts of a particular case together as a group. Ideally, cases should be isolated individually, and close contacts should be quarantined individually. However, some correctional facilities and detention centers do not have enough individual cells to do so and must consider cohorting as an alternative. See Quarantine and Medical Isolation\u00a0sections below for specific details about ways to implement cohorting to minimize the risk of disease spread and adverse health outcomes. Community transmission of COVID-19 \u2013 Community transmission of COVID-19 occurs when individuals acquire the disease through contact with someone in their local community, rather than through travel to an affected location. Once community transmission is identified in a particular area, correctional facilities and detention centers are more likely to start seeing cases inside their walls. Facilities should consult with local public health departments if assistance is needed in determining how to define \u201clocal community\u201d in the context of COVID-19 spread. However, because all states have reported cases, all facilities should be vigilant for introduction into their populations. Confirmed vs. Suspected COVID-19 case \u2013 A confirmed case has received a positive result from a COVID-19 laboratory test, with or without symptoms. A suspected case shows symptoms of COVID-19 but either has not been tested or is awaiting test results. If test results are positive, a suspected case becomes a confirmed case. Incarcerated/detained persons \u2013 For the purpose of this document, \u201cincarcerated/detained persons\u201d refers to persons held in a prison, jail, detention center, or other custodial setting where these guidelines are generally applicable. The term includes those who have been sentenced (i.e., in prisons) as well as those held for pre-trial (i.e., jails) or civil purposes (i.e, detention centers). Although this guidance does not specifically reference individuals in every type of custodial setting (e.g., juvenile facilities, community confinement facilities), facility administrators can adapt this guidance to apply to their specific circumstances as needed. Medical Isolation \u2013 Medical isolation refers to confining a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case (ideally to a single cell with solid walls and a solid door that closes), to prevent contact with others and to reduce the risk of transmission. Medical isolation ends when the individual meets pre-established clinical and/or testing criteria for release from isolation, in consultation with clinical providers and public health officials (detailed in guidance below). In this context, isolation does NOT refer to punitive isolation for behavioral infractions within the custodial setting. Staff are encouraged to use the term \u201cmedical isolation\u201d to avoid confusion. Quarantine \u2013 Quarantine refers to the practice of confining individuals who have had close contact with a COVID-19 case to determine whether they develop symptoms of the disease. Quarantine for COVID-19 should last for a period of 14 days. Ideally, each quarantined individual would be quarantined in a single cell with solid walls and a solid door that closes. If symptoms develop during the 14-day period, the individual should be placed under medical isolation\u00a0and evaluated for COVID-19. If symptoms do not develop, movement restrictions can be lifted, and the individual can return to their previous residency status within the facility. Social Distancing \u2013 Social distancing is the practice of increasing the space between individuals and decreasing the frequency of contact to reduce the risk of spreading a disease (ideally to maintain at least 6 feet between all individuals, even those who are asymptomatic). Social distancing strategies can be applied on an individual level (e.g., avoiding physical contact), a group level (e.g., canceling group activities where individuals will be in close contact), and an operational level (e.g., rearranging chairs in the dining hall to increase distance between them). Although social distancing is challenging to practice in correctional and detention environments, it is a cornerstone of reducing transmission of respiratory diseases such as COVID-19. Additional information about social distancing, including information on its use to reduce the spread of other viral illnesses, is available in this CDC publicationpdf icon. Staff \u2013 In this document, \u201cstaff\u201d refers to all public sector employees as well as those working for a private contractor within a correctional facility (e.g., private healthcare or food service). Except where noted, \u201cstaff\u201d does not distinguish between healthcare, custody, and other types of staff including private facility operators. Symptoms \u2013 Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Like other respiratory infections, COVID-19 can vary in severity from mild to severe.\u00a0When severe, pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death are possible. COVID-19 is a novel disease, therefore the full range of signs and symptoms, the clinical course of the disease, and the individuals and populations most at risk for disease and complications are not yet fully understood. Monitor the CDC website for updates on these topics. Facilities with Limited Onsite Healthcare Services Although many large facilities such as prisons and some jails usually employ onsite healthcare staff and have the capacity to evaluate incarcerated/detained persons for potential illness within a dedicated healthcare space, many smaller facilities do not. Some of these facilities have access to on-call healthcare staff or providers who visit the facility every few days. Others have neither onsite healthcare capacity nor onsite medical isolation/quarantine space and must transfer ill patients to other correctional or detention facilities or local hospitals for evaluation and care. The majority of the guidance below is designed to be applied to any correctional or detention facility, either as written or with modifications based on a facility\u2019s individual structure and resources. However, topics related to healthcare evaluation and clinical care of confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases and their close contacts may not apply directly to facilities with limited or no onsite healthcare services. It will be especially important for these types of facilities to coordinate closely with their state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health department when they encounter confirmed or suspected cases among incarcerated/detained persons or staff, in order to ensure effective medical isolation and quarantine, necessary medical evaluation and care, and medical transfer if needed. The guidance makes note of strategies tailored to facilities without onsite healthcare where possible. Note that all staff in any sized facility, regardless of the presence of onsite healthcare services, should observe guidance on recommended PPE in order to ensure their own safety when interacting with confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases. Facilities should make contingency plans for the likely event of PPE shortages\u00a0during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 Guidance for Correctional Facilities Guidance for correctional and detention facilities is organized into 3 sections: Operational Preparedness, Prevention, and Management of COVID-19. Recommendations across these sections can be applied simultaneously based on the progress of the outbreak in a particular facility and the surrounding community. Operational Preparedness. This guidance is intended to help facilities prepare for potential COVID-19 transmission in the facility. Strategies focus on operational and communications planning and personnel practices. Prevention.\u00a0 This guidance is intended to help facilities prevent spread of COVID-19 from outside the facility to inside. Strategies focus on reinforcing hygiene practices, intensifying cleaning and disinfection of the facility, screening (new intakes, visitors, and staff), continued communication with incarcerated/detained persons and staff, and social distancing measures (increasing distance between individuals). Management. This guidance is intended to help facilities clinically manage confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases inside the facility and prevent further transmission. Strategies include medical isolation and care of incarcerated/detained persons with symptoms (including considerations for cohorting), quarantine of cases\u2019 close contacts, restricting movement in and out of the facility, infection control practices for individuals interacting with cases and quarantined contacts or contaminated items, intensified social distancing, and cleaning and disinfecting areas visited by cases."}

Based on available information, pregnant people seem to have the same risk as adults who are not pregnant. However, we do know that Pregnant people have changes in their bodies that may increase their risk of some infections. Pregnant people have had a higher risk of severe illness when infected with viruses from the same family as COVID-19 and other viral respiratory infections, such as influenza. Pregnant people should protect themselves from COVID-19 Avoid people who are sick or who have been exposed to the virus. Clean your hands often using soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily. Risks to the pregnancy and to the baby Pregnant people have had a higher risk of severe illness when infected with viruses from the same family as COVID-19 and other viral respiratory infections, such as influenza. It is always important for pregnant people to protect themselves from illnesses. Mother-to-child transmission Mother-to-child transmission of coronavirus during pregnancy is unlikely, but after birth a newborn is susceptible to person-to-person spread. A very small number of babies have tested positive for the virus shortly after birth. However, it is unknown if these babies got the virus before or after birth. The virus has not been detected in amniotic fluid, breastmilk, or other maternal samples. Breastfeeding if you have COVID-19 Breast milk provides protection against many illnesses and is the best source of nutrition for most infants. You, along with your family and healthcare providers, should decide whether and how to start or continue breastfeeding In limited studies, COVID-19 has not been detected in breast milk; however we do not know for sure whether mothers with COVID-19 can spread the virus via breast milk. If you are sick and choose to direct breastfeed: Wear a facemask and wash your hands before each feeding. If the you are sick and choose to express breast milk: Express breast milk to establish and maintain milk supply. A dedicated breast pump should be provided. Wash hands before touching any pump or bottle parts and before expressing breast milk. Follow recommendations for proper pump cleaning (Espa\u00f1ol) after each use, cleaning all parts that come into contact with breast milk. If possible, consider having someone who is well feed the expressed breast milk to the infant."}

VirusPublic Health, Commercial and Clinical LaboratoriesPublic health, commercial and clinical laboratories are all testing for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and reporting their results.\u00a0 The national percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 increased from week 14 to week 15 and is as follows: Public health laboratories \u2013 increased from 17.3% during week 14 to 17.8% during week 15; Clinical laboratories \u2013 increased from 10.6% during week 14 to 11.5% during week 15; Commercial laboratories \u2013 increased from 20.6% during week 14 to 22.6% during week 15. Outpatient and Emergency Department VisitsOutpatient Influenza-Like Illness Network (ILINet) and National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP)Two indicators from existing surveillance systems are being monitored to track outpatient or emergency department (ED) visits for potential COVID-19 illness. Nationally, the percentages of visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) and COVID-19-like illness (CLI) are elevated but decreased compared to last week. Recent changes in health care seeking behavior are likely impacting data from both networks, making it difficult to draw further conclusions at this time. Tracking these systems moving forward will give additional insight into illness related to COVID-19. Severe Disease"}

What CDC\u00a0wants to learn The serology test looks for the presence of antibodies, which are specific proteins made in response to infections. Antibodies can be found in the blood and in other tissues of those who are tested after infection. The antibodies detected by this test indicate that a person had an immune response to SARS-CoV-2, whether symptoms developed from infection or the infection was asymptomatic. Antibody test results are important in detecting infections with few or no symptoms. Currently, CDC\u2019s serologic test is designed and validated for broad-based surveillance and research that will give us information needed to guide the response to the pandemic and protect the public\u2019s health. The test is not currently designed to test individuals who want to know if they have been previously infected with COVID-19. The results of these studies will allow us to estimate how many people have been infected nationally. The results will also provide information about the percentage of U.S. residents who have not had COVID-19 and are still at risk for infection. This research is designed to help us understand who has been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and determine factors that confer protection against this virus. Next Steps During the week of March 30, CDC and public health partners began the first stage of what will grow to be\u00a0wide\u00a0studies\u00a0of community\u00a0transmission of SARS-CoV-2. These initial studies use\u00a0serum\u00a0samples\u00a0collected in\u00a0the state of Washington and New York City. The second stage\u00a0will\u00a0expand to\u00a0include\u00a0serologic\u00a0testing in\u00a0more areas with high numbers of\u00a0people with\u00a0diagnosed infections. It will also include\u00a0studies of households in some states. CDC is evaluating commercially manufactured serologic tests in collaboration with the Biomedical Research and Development Authority, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense, and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. This evaluation is expected to be completed in late April. Commercially manufactured serologic tests that check for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in individuals are becoming increasingly available for use through healthcare providers. Serologic test results have limitations that make them less than ideal tools for diagnosing people who are sick. It typically takes one to two weeks after someone becomes sick with COVID-19 for their body to make antibodies; some people may take longer to develop antibodies. Depending on when someone was infected and the timing of the test, the test may not find antibodies in someone with a current COVID-19 infection.

No. For hemodialysis patients hospitalized with COVID-19, decisions about discharge from the hospital should be based on their clinical status and the ability of the outpatient dialysis facility to meet their care needs and adhere to recommended infection prevention and control practices. Decisions about hospital discharge are distinct from decisions about discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions. For patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, decisions about discontinuing Transmission-Based Precautions can be based on either a test-based or non-test-based strategy as outlined here. Test-based strategies are preferred, but NOT REQUIRED, and might not be possible due to limitations on availability of testing. If the patient is being discharged from the hospital but has not met criteria for discontinuing Transmission-Based Precautions, the outpatient dialysis facility should be prepared to follow all recommended infection prevention and control practices\u00a0for the care of a patient with COVID-19, including providing recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) to healthcare personnel. If the patient has met the criteria for discontinuing Transmission-Based Precautions, they do not require additional restrictions in the dialysis facility. However, as part of universal source control\u00a0efforts, and consistent with guidance for the community, all patients should wear a cloth face covering (if tolerated) at all times while in the facility. The hospital discharge planning team should communicate as early as possible with the receiving outpatient dialysis facility to ensure arrangements have been made for the patient to receive hemodialysis. The transportation company (if applicable) should also be notified of the patient\u2019s status. They should be aware of precautions they need to take when transporting patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, including what PPE transport personnel should wear and how to perform appropriate vehicle disinfection and cleaning. The patient should not take public transportation until they meet criteria for discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions. Is there a preferred hemodialysis modality (intermittent hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT)) for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in the acute care setting? Based on a patient\u2019s clinical status and the facility\u2019s resources, clinicians can decide to provide either intermittent hemodialysis or CRRT to patients requiring hemodialysis. For infection control purposes, limit the healthcare personnel (HCP) exposed to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 to those essential for their care. In the intensive care unit (ICU), CRRT is usually managed by an ICU nurse; due to this, use of CRRT may help limit the number of HCP exposed to the patient. For ICU patients with end-stage renal disease with a dialysis fistula or graft, clinicians can weigh the risks and benefits of placing a dialysis catheter for CRRT (in order to limit HCP exposure) or performing intermittent hemodialysis. Where should intermittent hemodialysis be performed in the acute care setting? For patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 requiring intermittent hemodialysis in the acute care setting, dialysis should ideally be performed in the patient\u2019s hospital room with the door closed. This serves to limit the patient\u2019s movement within the hospital. If the patient is to be dialyzed in the acute care dialysis unit, consider the following: Transporting patient to the acute care dialysis unit When a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 is being transported to the acute care dialysis unit, \u00a0ensure HCP adhere to recommended infection control practices. The patient should wear a facemask during transportation. Additional information about the personal protective equipment recommended for transport personnel is available here. Dialyzing patient in an acute care dialysis unit isolation room If the acute care dialysis unit has an isolation room, hemodialysis should be performed in the isolation room with the door closed. Hepatitis B isolation rooms should only be used for dialysis patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 if: 1) the patient is hepatitis B surface antigen positive or 2) the facility has no patients on the census with hepatitis B infection who would require treatment in the isolation room. The isolation room should be terminally cleaned after the care of each patient with COVID-19. Please refer to Question 5\u00a0for cleaning and disinfection of dialysis machine, equipment, and supplies. Dialyzing several patients with confirmed COVID-19 (cohorting) in a shared room in the acute care dialysis unit In a situation where there are several patients with confirmed COVID-19 requiring hemodialysis (non-ICU), consider cohorting the patients on the same dialysis shift, preferably the last dialysis shift of the day to allow for terminal cleaning of the dialysis unit following treatment. If possible, patients without COVID-19 should not receive dialysis during the same shift (in the same room); if patients without COVID-19 are dialyzed at the same time in the unit, they should be kept at least 6 feet away from the COVID-19 patients at all times. Patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should continue to wear their facemask during treatment and adhere to appropriate respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette. Please refer to \u00a0Question 5\u00a0for cleaning and disinfection of dialysis machine, equipment, and supplies. What are the recommendations for dialysis staff caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19? Dialysis staff performing dialysis treatment should use all PPE\u00a0recommended for the care of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Facilities should consider prioritizing respirators for fit-tested dialysis staff who spend several hours in a patient\u2019s room during a dialysis treatment with the door closed. If possible, dialysis staff should limit time in the room with the patient. The facility should consider having dialysis staff observe and monitor the patient through a window, glass door, or camera while keeping the door closed during the dialysis session. If dialysis staff are working from outside the room, the patient must be closely monitored at all times and care should be taken to prevent complications such as needle dislodgements and exsanguination. Do patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 need to wear masks during their dialysis treatment? Patients receiving dialysis in their own room or an isolation room do not need to wear a mask if dialysis staff are working from outside the room. If dialysis staff are remaining in the room with the patient, the patient should wear a facemask if tolerated. Dialysis staff in the room should use all recommended PPE. When patients with confirmed COVID-19 are being dialyzed in the acute dialysis unit, the patient should wear a facemask for the duration of treatment. Dialysis staff in the room should adhere to appropriate Transmission-Based Precautions and use all recommended PPE. What are the recommendations for cleaning and disinfecting the hemodialysis machine and equipment after use for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients? Current standards for routine cleaning and disinfection of hemodialysis equipment are appropriate for COVID-19. In Room Dialysis Treatment: It is important to follow your current process for disinfecting hemodialysis equipment, paying close attention to infection control practices to ensure that other equipment or surfaces are not cross-contaminated. When the dialysis machine, supplies, and equipment are moved out of a patient\u2019s room, the dialysis machine should go through routine cleaning and disinfection procedures. An EPA-registered, hospital-grade disinfectant should be used according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Please refer to List Nexternal icon\u00a0for products that have qualified under EPA\u2019s emerging viral pathogens program for use against SARS-CoV-2. When using products from List N, facilities should ensure the products also have a bloodborne pathogen claim (e.g., HIV, hepatitis B) Disposable medical supplies brought to the patient\u2019s room should be discarded. All non-dedicated, non-disposable medical equipment used for dialysis treatment should be cleaned and disinfected according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions and facility policies. Follow standard operating procedures for the disposal of used PPE and regulated medical waste. Review the dialysis machine\u2019s cleaning recommendations to ensure that disinfectants are compatible with the machine. Treatment on Dialysis Unit: Any surface, supplies, or equipment such as the dialysis machine, located within 6 feet of symptomatic patients, should be disinfected or discarded appropriately. Disposable medical supplies brought to the dialysis station should be discarded. All non-dedicated, non-disposable medical equipment used for patient care should be cleaned and disinfected according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions and facility policies. Staff should follow standard operating procedures for the disposal of used PPE and regulated medical waste. If linens or disposable cover sheets are used on the dialysis chairs, follow standard procedures for containing and/or laundering used items. Additional information about recommended practices for terminal cleaning of rooms and PPE to be worn by environmental services personnel is available in the Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control FAQs for COVID-19. When CRRT is performed, is there a specific recommendation for disposing effluent from patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19? Dialysis effluent from suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients can be disposed of per standard facility protocols. HCP caring for the patient in the patient room or disposing of effluent from the CRRT machine should wear recommended PPE (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/infection-control/control-recommendations.html). What are the recommendations for cleaning and disinfecting the CRRT machine and equipment after use for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients? When the CRRT machine is being moved out of a patient\u2019s room, the CRRT machine should be cleaned and disinfected per routine procedures. An EPA-registered, hospital-grade disinfectant should be used according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Please refer to List Nexternal icon for products that have qualified under EPA\u2019s emerging viral pathogens program for use against SARS-CoV-2. When using products from List N, facilities should ensure the products also have a bloodborne pathogen claim such as for HIV or hepatitis B. Many CRRT machines do not have internal fluid pathways, so only external surfaces need to be cleaned and disinfected. There are several germicidal wipesexternal icon\u00a0that can be used. For touch screens, check manufacturer\u2019s instructions for use for compatible products that can be used; some may not be compatible with chlorine or alcohol containing products. If the machine has an internal pathway, refer to manufacturer\u2019s instructions for disinfection. What are the discharge planning considerations for hemodialysis patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19? When patients requiring maintenance hemodialysis are deemed appropriate for discharge, the accepting dialysis facility should be notified of the patient\u2019s COVID-19 testing status. This will allow the accepting facility to institute appropriate Transmission-Based Precautions as described in the following guidance https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/healthcare-facilities/dialysis.html The discharging facility and accepting dialysis facility should ensure transportation to and from the dialysis facility can be done safely. For information on discontinuing Transmission-based Precautions see: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-hospitalized-patients.html"}

{"title": "Considerations for Pharmacies during the COVID-19 Pandemic", "time": "2020-4-16 00:00:00", "author": "", "link": "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/pharmacies.html", "content": "On This Page Universal use of face coverings for source controlAdvice for sick staffFilling prescriptionsStrategies to minimize close contactCOVID-19 testing and other close-contact services Summary of Recent ChangesBelow are changes to the guidance as of April 14, 2020: Everyone entering the pharmacy should wear a face covering, regardless of symptoms. Cloth face coverings should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance. Pharmacists and pharmacy technicians should always wear a facemask while they are in the pharmacy for source control. Postpone and reschedule delivery of some routine clinical preventive services, such as adult immunizations, which require face to face encounters. Special considerations for clinics that are co-located in pharmacies. This guidance applies to all pharmacy staff to minimize their risk of exposure to the virus and reduce the risk for customers during the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0 As a vital part of the healthcare system, pharmacies play an important role in providing medicines, therapeutics, vaccines, and critical health services to the public. Ensuring continuous function of pharmacies during the COVID-19 pandemic is important. During the pandemic, pharmacy staff can minimize their risk of exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19 and reduce the risk for customers by using the principles of infection prevention and control and social distancing. Implement universal use of face coverings Individuals without coronavirus symptoms (\u201casymptomatic\u201d) and those who eventually develop symptoms (\u201cpre-symptomatic\u201d) can transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms.\u00a0 This means that the virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity\u2014for example, speaking, coughing, or sneezing\u2014even if those people are not exhibiting symptoms. Everyone entering the pharmacy should wear a face covering for source control (i.e., to protect other people in case the person is infected), regardless of symptoms. CDC recommends persons entering public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies)\u00a0wear a cloth face covering especially\u00a0in areas of significant community-based transmission. Cloth face coverings should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance. Pharmacists and pharmacy technicians should always wear a facemask while they are in the pharmacy for source control. When available, facemasks are generally preferred over cloth face coverings for healthcare professionals (HCP) for source control. If there are shortages of facemasks, facemasks should be prioritized for HCP who need them for PPE.\u00a0 Cloth face coverings should NOT be worn instead of a respirator or facemask if more than source control is required. Advise staff who are sick to stay home Make sure that pharmacy staff who have fever or symptoms that may be due to COVID-19 stay home\u00a0and away from the workplace until they have recovered. Ensure that sick leave policies are flexible, nonpunitive, and consistent with public health guidance and that employees are aware of and understand these policies. Filling prescriptions Although the actual process of preparing medications for dispensing is not a direct patient care activity, the other components of medication dispensing such as prescription intake, patient counseling, or patient education may expose pharmacy staff to individuals who may have respiratory illness. In addition to following\u00a0workplace guidance, pharmacy staff should: Provide hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol on counters for use by customers and have sufficient and easy access to soap and water or hand sanitizer for staff. Encourage all prescribers to submit prescription orders via telephone or electronically. The pharmacy should develop procedures to avoid handling paper prescriptions, in accordance with appropriate state laws, regulations, or executive orders. After a prescription has been prepared, the packaged medication can be placed on a counter for the customer to retrieve, instead of being directly handed to the customer. Other strategies to limit direct contact with customers include: Avoid handling insurance or benefit cards. Instead, have the customer take a picture of the card for processing or read aloud the information that is needed (in a private location so other customers cannot hear). Avoid touching objects that have been handled by customers. If transfer of items must occur, pharmacy staff should wash their hands afterwards with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol. They should always avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands. Use strategies to minimize close contact between staff and customers and between customers: Use engineering controls where the customer and pharmacy staff interact, such as the pharmacy counter, to minimize close contact: Minimize physical contact with customers and between customers. Maintain social distancing (6 feet between individuals) for people entering the pharmacy as much as possible. Use signage/barriers and floor markers to instruct waiting customers to remain 6 feet back from the counter, from other customer interfaces, and from other customers and pharmacy staff. To shield against droplets from coughs or sneezes, install a section of clear plastic at the customer contact area to provide barrier protection (e.g., Plexiglas type material or clear plastic sheet). Configure with a pass-through opening\u00a0at the bottom of the barrier for people to speak through or to provide pharmacy items, if feasible. For hard non-porous surfaces, clean with detergent or soap and water if the surfaces are visibly dirty prior to disinfectant application. Frequently clean and disinfect all customer service counters and customer contact areas. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces such as workstations, keyboards, telephones, and doorknobs. Use EPA\u2019s Registered Antimicrobial Products for Use Against Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2external icon, the virus that causes COVID-19. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for concentration, application method, and contact time for all cleaning and disinfecting products. Discontinue the use of magazines and other shared items in pharmacy waiting areas. Ensure that the waiting area is cleaned regularly. Promote the use of self-serve checkout registers and clean and disinfect them frequently. Encourage the use of, and have hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes available at register locations for use by customers. Minimize physical contact with customers and between customers at checkout areas in the front of store. Staff that serve customers in the checkout areas (other than in the pharmacy area) should wear a cloth face covering, especially in areas of significant community-based transmission. Use administrative controls\u2014 such as protocols or changes to work practices, policies, or procedures \u2014 to keep staff and customers separated: Promote social distancing by diverting as many customers as possible to drive-through windows, curbside pick-up, or home delivery, where feasible. Large, outdoor signage asking customers to use the drive-through window or call for curbside pick-up can be useful. Include text or automated telephone messages that specifically ask sick customers to stay home and request home delivery or send a well family member or friend to pick up their medicine. Limit the number of customers in the pharmacy at any given time to prevent crowding at the pharmacy counter or checkout areas. Pharmacists who are providing patients with chronic disease management services, medication management services, and other services that do not require face-to-face encounters should make every effort to use telephone, telehealth, or tele-pharmacy strategies. Postpone and reschedule delivery of some routine clinical preventive services, such as adult immunizations, which require face to face encounters. Pharmacy staff can ensure that patients seeking vaccinations are sent reminders to return to the pharmacy at a later date. Close self-serve blood pressure units. Reduce risk during COVID-19 testing and other close-contact pharmacy care services Pharmacies that are participating in public health testing for COVID-19 should communicate with local and state public health staff to determine which persons meet the criteria for testing. State and local health departments will inform pharmacies about procedures to collect, store, and ship specimens appropriately, including during afterhours or on weekends/holidays. Some pharmacies are including self-collection options. In the \u201cCDC Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings,\u201d there is\u00a0guidance for collecting respiratory specimens. Pharmacy staff conducting COVID-19 testing and other close-contact patient care procedures that will likely elicit coughs or sneezes (e.g., influenza and strep testing) should be provided with appropriate PPE. Staff who use respirators must be familiar with proper use and follow a complete respiratory protection program that complies with OSHA Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134). Staff should also have training in the appropriate donning and doffing of PPE. Cloth face coverings should NOT be worn by staff instead of a respirator or facemask if more than source control is required. Special considerations for clinics that are co-located in pharmacies Post signs at the door instructing clinic patients with respiratory illness to return to their vehicles (or remain outside if pedestrians) and call the telephone number for the clinic so that proper triage can be performed before they enter the store. It may be possible to manage patients with mild symptoms telephonically and send them home with instructions for care. Facemasks or cloth face coverings should be provided for all patients if they are not already wearing one, ideally prior to entering the store. Where possible, provide separate entrances for all clinic patients. Otherwise create a clear path from the main door to the clinic, with partitions or other physical barriers (if feasible), to minimize contact with other customers.

CDC does not generally issue advisories or restrictions for travel within the United States. However, cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been reported in all states, and some areas are experiencing community spread of the disease. Crowded travel settings, like airports, may increase chances of getting COVID-19, if there are other travelers with coronavirus infection. There are several things you should consider when deciding whether it is safe for you to travel. Things to consider before travel Is COVID-19 spreading in the area where you\u2019re going? If COVID-19 is spreading at your destination, but not where you live, you may be more likely to get infected if you travel there than if you stay home. If you have questions about your destination, you should check your destination\u2019s local health department website for more information. State or local governments may have issued orders or provided additional guidance. Check public health departments for detailed information. Will you or your travel companion(s) be in close contact with others during your trip? Your risk of exposure to respiratory viruses like coronavirus may increase in crowded settings, particularly closed-in settings with little air circulation. This may include settings such as conferences, public events (like concerts and sporting events), religious gatherings, public spaces (like movie theatres and shopping malls), and public transportation (like buses, metro, trains). Are you or your travel companion(s) more likely to get severe illness if you get COVID-19? People at higher risk for severe disease are older adults and people of any age with serious underlying medical conditions\u00a0(such as heart disease, lung disease, or diabetes). CDC recommends that travelers at higher risk for COVID-19 complications\u00a0avoid all cruise travel and nonessential air travel. Things to consider after travel Do you have a plan for taking time off from work or school, in case you are told to stay home for 14 days for self-monitoring or if you get sick with COVID-19? If you have close contact with someone with COVID-19 during travel, you may be asked to stay home to self-monitor and avoid contact with others for up to 14 days after travel. If you become sick with COVID-19, you may be unable to go to work or school until you\u2019re considered noninfectious. You will be asked to avoid contact with others (including being in public places) during this period of infectiousness. Do you live with someone who is older or has a serious underlying medical condition? If you get sick with COVID-19 upon your return from travel, your household contacts may be at risk of infection. Household contacts who are older adults or persons of any age with serious underlying medical conditions\u00a0are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Is COVID-19 spreading where you live? You may not realize you are infectious if your symptoms are mild or you don\u2019t have a fever. Consider the risk of passing COVID-19 to others during travel, particularly if you will be in close contact with people who are older adults or have a serious underlying medical condition\u00a0These people are at higher risk of getting very sick. If your symptoms are mild or you don\u2019t have a fever, you may not realize you are infectious. If you must travel If you must travel, be sure to take steps to help prevent\u00a0getting and spreading COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases during travel.

What about for pregnant HCP?Adherence to recommended infection prevention and control practices is an important part of protecting HCP and patients in healthcare settings. All HCP who care for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients should adhere to standard and transmission based precautions. To the extent feasible, healthcare facilities could consider prioritizing HCP who are not at higher risk of developing severe illness from COVID-19 or who are not pregnant to care for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients. If staffing shortages make this challenging, facilities could consider restricting HCP at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 or who are pregnant from being present for higher risk procedures (e.g., aerosol-generating procedures) on COVID-19 patients. Find more information for facilities on mitigating HCP staffing shortages. HCP who are concerned about their individual risk for severe illness from COVID-19 due to underlying medical conditions while caring for COVID-19 patients can discuss their concerns with their supervisor or occupational health services. People 65 years and older and people of all ages with serious underlying health conditions\u00a0\u2014 like serious heart conditions, chronic lung disease, and diabetes \u2014 seem to be at higher risk of developing severe illness from COVID-19. Information on COVID-19 in pregnancy is limited. Pregnant women are not currently considered at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. \u00a0However, pregnant women have had a higher risk of severe illness when infected with viruses from the same family as COVID-19 and other viral respiratory infections, such as influenza. Find more information on pregnancy\u00a0and risk for severe illness from COVID-19. I am a HCP living with someone who is at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. What precautions should I take?Take the same precautions recommended for people at higher risk\u00a0of severe illness from COVID-19. There are no additional precautions for HCP. Some HCP may choose to implement extra measures when arriving home from providing healthcare, such as removing any clothing worn during delivery of healthcare, taking off shoes, washing clothing, and immediately showering. However, these are optional personal practices because there is insufficient evidence on whether they are effective. Who is at risk for infection with the virus that causes COVID-19?Currently, those at greatest risk of infection are persons who have had prolonged, unprotected close contact with a patient with symptomatic, confirmed COVID-19 and those who live in or have recently been to areas with sustained transmission. For more information, see Risk Assessment. Who is at risk for severe disease from COVID-19?The available data are currently insufficient to clearly identify risk factors for severe clinical outcomes. Based on limited data that are available for COVID-19 patients, and data from related coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and MERS-CoV, people who may be at risk for more severe outcomes include older adults and persons who have certain underlying chronic medical conditions. Those underlying chronic conditions include chronic lung disease, moderate to severe asthma, cardiac disease with complications, diabetes, or immunocompromising conditions. See also Interim Clinical Guidance for Management of Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Information for Healthcare Professionals: COVID-19 and Underlying Conditions. If my patient has one of the underlying medical conditions listed, what is my patient\u2019s risk and what should I tell my patient? There is insufficient information on COVID-19 to determine risk for each underlying medical condition. Epidemiologists at CDC are analyzing data around the clock to help us more precisely understand the risks of COVID-19. Information will be shared as soon as it\u2019s available. You know your patient \u2013 their overall health and how well their conditions are managed. Use your clinical judgement to evaluate on a case by case basis. Tell patients with underlying medical conditions\u00a0that increase their risk of severe illness or poorer outcomes from COVID-19: To stay home\u00a0as much as possible to reduce their risk of being exposed. Encourage patients to closely follow their care plans for management of their chronic disease, including better glycemic or blood pressure control. If possible, work with patients to manage their underlying condition to the best of their ability, including ensuring that patients have sufficient medication and supplies. Encourage all patients, regardless of risk, to: Take steps\u00a0to protect yourself. Call\u00a0your healthcare provider if you are sick with a fever, cough, or shortness of breath. Follow CDC travel guidelines\u00a0and the recommendations of your state and local health officials. Fear and anxiety about a disease can feel overwhelming, especially for those who might be at higher risk or are experiencing social isolation, and for healthcare providers that are treating patients at higher risk. Do what you can to take care of your mental health and encourage your patients to do the same. Are pregnant healthcare personnel at increased risk for adverse outcomes if they care for patients with COVID-19?Pregnant healthcare personnel (HCP) should follow risk assessment and infection control\u00a0guidelines for HCP exposed to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Adherence to recommended infection prevention and control practices is an important part of protecting all HCP in healthcare settings. Information on COVID-19 in pregnancy is very limited; facilities may want to consider limiting exposure of pregnant HCP to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, especially during higher risk procedures (e.g., aerosol-generating procedures) if feasible based on staffing availability. TransmissionWhen is someone infectious?The onset and duration of viral shedding and the period of infectiousness for COVID-19 are not yet known. It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be detectable in the upper or lower respiratory tract for weeks after illness onset, similar to infections with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. However, detection of viral RNA does not necessarily mean that infectious virus is present. There are reports of asymptomatic infections (detection of virus with no development of symptoms) and pre-symptomatic infections (detection of virus prior to development of symptoms) with SARS-CoV-2, but their role in transmission is not yet known. Based on existing literature, the incubation period (the time from exposure to development of symptoms) of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses (e.g. MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV) ranges from 2\u201314 days. Which body fluids can spread infection?SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in upper and lower respiratory tract specimens, and SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated from upper respiratory tract specimens and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in blood and stool specimens, and SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated in cell culture from the stool of some patients, including a patient with pneumonia 15 days after symptom onset. The duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in upper and lower respiratory tract specimens and in extrapulmonary specimens is not yet known but may be several weeks or longer. Duration of several week or longer has been observed in cases of MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection. While viable, infectious SARS-CoV has been isolated from respiratory, blood, urine, and stool specimens, viable, infectious MERS-CoV has only been isolated from respiratory tract specimens. It is not yet known whether other non-respiratory body fluids from an infected person including vomit, urine, breast milk, or semen can contain viable, infectious SARS-CoV-2. Can people who recover from COVID-19 be re-infected with SARS-CoV-2?The immune response, including duration of immunity, to SARS-CoV-2 infection is not yet understood. Patients with MERS-CoV are unlikely to be re-infected shortly after they recover, but it is not yet known whether similar immune protection will be observed for patients with COVID-19. Testing, Diagnosis, and NotificationHow do you test a patient for infection with SARS-CoV-2? Clinicians are able to access laboratory testing through a network of state and local public health laboratories across the country. The Association of Public Health Laboratoriesexternal iconexternal icon provides a list of states and territories with laboratories that are using COVID-19 diagnostic tests. For more information, see Testing in U.S. Clinicians should direct testing questions to their state health departments. Several clinical laboratories are receiving authorization for testing from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under an Emergency Use Authorization. They are expected to be able to offer a larger volume of testing for COVID-19. You can contact your current laboratory vendor to find out when the test will be available. There are a number of commercially available SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assays that have received FDA Emergency Use Authorizationexternal iconexternal icon. See recommendations for reporting, testing, and specimen collection at Evaluating and Testing Persons for COVID-19. Do existing commercially available multiple respiratory virus panels, such as those manufactured by Biofire or Genmark, detect SARS-CoV-2?Not currently. These multi-pathogen molecular assays can detect a number of human respiratory viruses, including other human coronaviruses that can cause acute respiratory illness, but they do not currently detect SARS-CoV-2. In the future, it is expected that these assays will have the ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens. If a patient tests positive for another respiratory virus, should that exclude SARS-CoV-2 as a cause of illness?Patients can be infected with more than one virus at the same time. Coinfections with other respiratory viruses in people with COVID-19 have been reported. Therefore, identifying infection with one respiratory virus does not exclude SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. Should chest CT be used for diagnosis of COVID-19?Clinicians considering use of chest CT scans for diagnosis or management of COVID-19 patients should consider whether such imaging will change clinical management. The American College of Radiology (ACR) recommends that CT should not be used to screen for COVID-19, or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19, and that CT should be used sparingly and reserved for hospitalized, symptomatic patients with specific clinical indications for CT. Appropriate infection control procedures should be followed before scanning subsequent patients. For more information see, ACR Recommendations for the use of Chest Radiography and Computed Tomography (CT) for Suspected COVID-19 Infectionexternal iconexternal icon. Whom should healthcare providers notify if they suspect a patient has COVID-19?Healthcare Providers should immediately notify infection control personnel at their facility if they suspect COVID-19 in a patient. Providers should then consult with local or state health departments to determine whether patients meet criteria for a Persons Under Investigation (PUI), see Evaluating and Testing Persons for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Treatment and ManagementShould post-exposure prophylaxis be used for people who may have been exposed to a person with COVID-19?There is currently no FDA-approved post-exposure prophylaxis for people who may have been exposed to COVID-19. For information about registered clinical trials of investigational therapeutics for pre or post exposure prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, visit ClinicalTrials.govexternal icon. For more information on movement restrictions, monitoring for symptoms, and evaluation after possible exposure to COVID-19, see Interim US Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Persons with Potential Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Exposure in Travel-associated or Community Settings and Interim U.S Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure in a Healthcare Setting to Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). How are COVID-19 patients treated?Not all patients with COVID-19 will require medical supportive care. Clinical management for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is focused on supportive care for complications, including supplemental oxygen and advanced organ support for respiratory failure, septic shock, and multi-organ failure. Empiric testing and treatment for other viral or bacterial etiologies may be warranted. Corticosteroids are\u00a0not routinely recommended for treatment of viral pneumonia or ARDS, due to the potential for prolonging viral replication, as has been observed with MERS coronavirus and influenza. Corticosteroids should be avoided unless they are indicated for another reason (e.g., COPD exacerbation or refractory septic shock following the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelinesexternal iconexternal icon). For information on investigational therapies, see Therapeutic Options for Patients with COVID-19. Do patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 need to be admitted to the hospital?Not all patients with COVID-19 require hospital admission. Patients whose clinical presentation warrants in-patient clinical management for supportive medical care should be admitted to the hospital under appropriate isolation precautions. Some patients with initial mild clinical presentation may worsen in the second week of illness. The decision to monitor these patients in the inpatient or outpatient setting should be made on a case-by-case basis. This decision will depend not only on the clinical presentation, but also on the patient\u2019s ability to engage in self-monitoring, the feasibility of safe isolation at home, and the risk of transmission in the patient\u2019s home environment. For more information, see Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a Healthcare Setting and Interim Guidance for Implementing Home Care of People Not Requiring Hospitalization for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). When can patients with confirmed COVID-19 be discharged from the hospital?Patients can be discharged from the healthcare facility whenever clinically indicated. Isolation should be maintained at home if the patient returns home before the time period recommended for discontinuation of hospital Transmission-Based Precautions. Decisions to discontinue Transmission-Based Precautions or in-home isolation can be made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with clinicians, infection prevention and control specialists, and public health authorities based upon multiple factors, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for COVID-19 in respiratory specimens. See Interim Considerations for Disposition of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19. For non-hospitalized persons, see Interim Guidance for Implementing Home Care of People Not Requiring Hospitalization for COVID-19, and Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Immunocompromised Persons. Obstetrical CareDoes CDC recommend use of facemasks or respirators for healthcare personnel (HCP) caring for pregnant patients with known or suspected COVID-19 infection?When available, respirators (or facemasks if a respirator is not available), eye protection, gloves, and gowns should be used for the care of patients with known or suspected COVID-19 infection, including women who are pregnant. For more information, please see Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings. How should the use of N95 respirators be prioritized within obstetric healthcare settings during shortages?During respirator shortages, care should be taken to ensure that N95 respirators are reserved for situations where respiratory protection is most important, such as performance of aerosol-generating procedures on patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. In such shortage situations, facemasks might be used for other types of patient care. Alternatives to N95 respirators might be considered where feasible. These include other classes of NIOSH-approved filtering facepiece respirators, half facepiece or full facepiece elastomeric respirators, and powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) where feasible. All of these alternatives will provide equivalent or higher protection than N95 respirators when properly worn. However, PAPRs and elastomeric respirators should not be used in surgical settings due to concerns that exhaled air may contaminate the sterile field. For more information please see: Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of N95 Respirators: Conventional Capacity Strategies. When respirator supplies are restored, the facility can switch back to use of N95 respirators for all care of patients with known or suspected COVID-19 infection. For more information, please see Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings. Is forceful exhalation during the second stage of labor considered an aerosol-generating procedure for respirator prioritization during shortages?Based on limited data, forceful exhalation during the second stage of labor would not be expected to generate aerosols to the same extent as procedures more commonly considered to be aerosol generating (such as bronchoscopy, intubation, and open suctioning. Forceful exhalation during the second stage of labor is not considered an aerosol-generating procedure for respirator prioritization during shortages over procedures more likely to generate higher concentrations of infectious respiratory aerosols. When respirator supplies are restored, as with all clinical care activities for patients with known or suspected COVID-19, HCP should use respirators (or facemasks if a respirator is not available), eye protection, gloves, and gowns during the second stage of labor, in addition to other personal protective equipment that may be typically indicated for labor and delivery. For more information please see: Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control FAQs Is use of high-flow oxygen considered an aerosol-generating procedure for respirator prioritization during shortages?Based on limited data, high-flow oxygen use is not considered an aerosol-generating procedure for respirator prioritization during shortages over procedures more likely to generate higher concentrations of infectious respiratory aerosols (such as bronchoscopy, intubation, and open suctioning). Patients with known or suspected COVID-19 should receive any interventions they would normally receive as standard of care. When respirator supplies are restored, as with all clinical care activities for patients with known or suspected COVID-19, respirators (or facemasks if a respirator is not available), eye protection, gloves, and gowns should be used by HCP for the care of pregnant patients with known or suspected COVID-19. For more information please see: Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control FAQs Should intrapartum fever be considered as a possible sign of COVID-19 infection?Clinicians should use their judgment to determine if a patient has signs and symptoms\u00a0compatible with COVID-19 and whether the patient should be tested. Fever is the most commonly reported sign; most patients with confirmed COVID-19 have developed fever\u00a0and/or symptoms of acute respiratory illness (cough, difficulty breathing). Data regarding COVID-19 in pregnancy are limited; according to current information, presenting signs and symptoms are expected to be similar to those for non-pregnant patients, including the presence of fever. Other considerations that may guide testing are epidemiologic factors such as the occurrence of local community transmission of COVID-19 infections. As part of evaluation, clinicians are strongly encouraged to test for other causes of respiratory illness and peripartum fever. For more information please see: Evaluating and Testing Persons for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) What guidance is available for labor and delivery HCP with potential exposure in a healthcare setting to patients with COVID-19 infection?HCP in labor and delivery healthcare settings should follow the same infection prevention and control recommendations and personal protective equipment recommendations as all other HCP. If HCP are exposed to patients with COVID-19 infection, guidance is available for HCP and healthcare facilities on steps to take. For more information, please see: Interim U.S. Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure in a Healthcare Setting to Patients with Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Drugs and Investigational TherapiesAre empiric antibiotics recommended for patients suspected of having COVID-19?Several patients with COVID-19 have been reported to present with concurrent community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. Decisions to administer antibiotics to COVID-19 patients should be based on the likelihood of bacterial infection (community-acquired or hospital-acquired), illness severity, and antimicrobial stewardship issues. For more information, see Diagnosis and Treatment of Adults with Community-acquired Pneumonia: An Official Clinical Practice Guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of Americaexternal iconexternal icon. What antiviral drugs are available to treat COVID-19?There are currently no antiviral drugs approved by FDA to treat COVID-19. See Interim Clinical Guidance for Management of Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). For information on use of investigational drugs for treatment of patients with COVID-19, see Therapeutic Options for Patients with COVID-19. For information on specific clinical trials underway for treatment of patients with COVID-19 infection, visit clinicaltrials.govexternal icon. Should angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) or Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARB) be stopped in patients with COVID-19?CDC is currently not aware of scientific evidence establishing a link between ACE-I or ARBs and risk of contracting or severity of COVID-19. The American Heart Association, the Heart Failure Society of America, and the American College of Cardiology recommendexternal icon\u00a0continuation of ACE-I or ARB medications for all patients already prescribed those medications for indications such as heart failure, hypertension, or ischemic heart disease. Cardiovascular disease patients who are diagnosed with COVID-19 should be fully evaluated by a healthcare professional before adding or removing any treatments, and any changes to their treatment should be based on the latest scientific evidence. Patients who rely on ACE-I or ARBs to treat chronic conditions and have additional questions should speak to their healthcare provider for individualized management. Do nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) worsen the course of disease for people with COVID-19?CDC is currently not aware of scientific evidence establishing a link between NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen) and worsening of COVID\u201119. FDAexternal iconexternal icon, the European Medicines Agencyexternal icon, the World Health Organization, and CDC are continuing to monitor the situation and will review new information on the effects of NSAIDs and COVID-19 disease as it becomes available. For those who wish to use treatment options other than NSAIDs, there are other over-the-counter and prescription medications approved for pain relief and fever reduction. Patients who rely on NSAIDs to treat chronic conditions and have additional questions should speak to their healthcare provider for individualized management. Patients should use NSAIDs, and all medications, according to the product labels and advice of their healthcare professional. Waste ManagementWhat do waste management companies need to know about wastewater and sewage coming from a healthcare facility or community setting with either a known COVID-19 patient or person under investigation (PUI)?Waste generated in the care of PUIs or patients with confirmed COVID-19 does not present additional considerations for wastewater disinfection in the United States. Coronaviruses are susceptible to the same disinfection conditions in community and healthcare settings as other viruses, so current disinfection conditions in wastewater treatment facilities are expected to be sufficient. This includes conditions for practices such as oxidation with hypochlorite (i.e., chlorine bleach) and peracetic acid, as well as inactivation using UV irradiation. Do wastewater and sewage workers need any additional protection when handling untreated waste from healthcare or community setting with either a known COVID-19 patient or PUI?Wastewater workers should use standard practices including basic hygiene precautions and wear the recommended PPE\u00a0as prescribed for their current work tasks when handling untreated waste. There is no evidence to suggest that employees of wastewater plants need any additional protections in relation to COVID-19. Should medical waste or general waste from healthcare facilities treating PUIs and patients with confirmed COVID-19 be handled any differently or need any additional disinfection?Medical waste (trash) coming from healthcare facilities treating COVID-2019 patients is no different than waste coming from facilities without COVID-19 patients. CDC\u2019s guidance states that management of laundry, food service utensils, and medical waste should be performed in accordance with routine procedures. There is no evidence to suggest that facility waste needs any additional disinfection. More guidance about environmental infection control is available in section 7 of CDC\u2019s Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations\u00a0for Patients with Confirmed COVID-19 or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings."}

Individuals, communities, schools, business and health care organizations all have a role to play in community mitigation, and policies, like limits on large gatherings, restrictions on businesses, and school closures, are often needed in order to fully implement community mitigation strategies Each community is unique and because some of these measures can be very\u00a0disruptive to daily life, appropriate mitigation strategies will vary based on the level of community transmission, characteristics of the community and their populations, and the local capacity to implement strategies. Consideration is needed for all aspects of a community that might be impacted, including populations most vulnerable to severe illness and those that may be more impacted socially or economically, and select appropriate actions. When selecting mitigation strategies, states and communities should be guided by the local characteristics of disease transmission, demographics, and public health and healthcare system capacity.

If you are caring for someone at home, monitor for emergency signs, prevent the spread of germs, treat symptoms, and carefully consider when to end home isolation. *Note: Older adults and people of any age with certain serious underlying medical conditions like lung disease, heart disease, or diabetes are at higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness and should seek care as soon as symptoms start. COVID-19 spreads between people who are in close contact (within about 6 feet) through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. Recent studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19. Monitor the person for worsening symptoms. Know the emergency warning signs. Have their healthcare provider\u2019s contact information on hand. If they are getting sicker, call their healthcare provider. For medical emergencies, call 911 and notify the dispatch personnel that they have or are suspected to have COVID-19. When to Seek Medical AttentionIf you develop emergency warning signs\u00a0for COVID-19 get medical attention immediately. Emergency warning signs include*: Trouble breathing Persistent pain or pressure in the chest New confusion or inability to arouse Bluish lips or face *This list is not all inclusive. Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning. Call 911 if you have a medical emergency: Notify the operator that you have, or think you might have, COVID-19. If possible, put on a cloth face covering before medical help arrives. Prevent the spread of germs when caring for someone who is sick Have the person stay in one room, away from other people, including yourself, as much as possible. If possible, have them use a separate bathroom. Avoid sharing personal household items, like dishes, towels, and bedding Have them wear a cloth face covering\u00a0(that covers their nose and mouth) when they are around people, including you. It the sick person can\u2019t wear a cloth face covering, you should wear one while in the same room with them. If the sick person needs to be around others (within the home, in a vehicle, or doctor\u2019s office), they should wear a cloth face covering that covers their mouth and nose. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after interacting with the sick person. If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Every day, clean all surfaces that are touched often, like counters, tabletops, and doorknobs Use household cleaning sprays or wipes according to the label instructions. Wash laundry thoroughly. If laundry is soiled, wear disposable gloves and keep the soiled items away from your body while laundering. Wash your hands immediately after removing gloves. Avoid having any unnecessary visitors. For any additional questions about their care, contact their healthcare provider or state or local health department. Provide symptom treatment Make sure the sick person drinks a lot of fluids to stay hydrated and rests at home. Over-the-counter medicines may help with symptoms. For most people, symptoms last a few days and get better after a week. When to end home isolation (staying home) People with COVID-19 who have stayed home (are home isolated) can stop home isolation under the following conditions: If they will not have a test to determine if they are still contagious, they can leave home after these three things have happened: They have had no fever for at least 72 hours (that is three full days of no fever without the use medicine that reduces fevers) AND other symptoms have improved (for example, when their cough or shortness of breath have improved) AND at least 7 days have passed since their symptoms first appeared If they will be tested to determine if they are still contagious, they can leave home after these three things have happened: They no longer have a fever (without the use medicine that reduces fevers) AND other symptoms have improved (for example, when their cough or shortness of breath have improved) AND They received two negative tests in a row, 24 hours apart. Their doctor will follow CDC guidelines. Resources Caring For Someone Who Might Have COVID (American Sign Language)"}

State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC, whereas medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers. How to decide if you should be tested or seek care Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19. Here is some information that might help you make decisions about seeking medical care or testing. Most people have mild illness and are able to recover at home without medical care. They may not need to be tested. There is no treatment specifically approved for people who have COVID-19. CDC has guidance\u00a0for who should be tested, but decisions about testing are at the discretion of state and local health departments and/or individual clinicians. Clinicians should work with their state and local health departments to coordinate testing through public health laboratories, or work with clinical or commercial laboratories. How to get tested COVID-19 testing differs by location. If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and want to get tested, call your medical provider first. You can also visit your state or localexternal icon health department\u2019s website to look for the latest local information on testing. While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find a place to get tested. What to do after you are tested If you test positive for COVID-19, know what protective steps to take If You Are Sick or Caring for Someone. If you test negative for COVID-19, you probably were not infected at the time your specimen was collected. However, that does not mean you will not get sick. It is possible that you were very early in your infection when your specimen was collected and that you could test positive later. Or you could be exposed later and then develop illness. In other words, a negative test result does not rule out getting sick later. Community transmission of COVID-19 is occurring in parts of the United States. In the coming months, most of the U.S. population will be exposed to this virus. You should continue to practice all the protective measures recommended to keep yourself and others from getting infected. See How to Protect Yourself.

{"title": "Considerations When Preparing for COVID-19 in Assisted Living Facilities", "time": "2020-4-15 00:00:00", "author": "", "link": "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/assisted-living.html", "content": "Key Actions Assisted living facility (ALF) owners and administrators are urged to implement these recommendations to protect their residents and staff. They should ensure staff know how to contact the health department for any of the following: If COVID-19 is suspected or confirmed among residents or facility personnel If a resident develops severe respiratory infection If more than 2 residents or facility personnel develop fever or respiratory symptoms within 72 hours of each other. CDC has resourcespdf icon that can assist with tracking infections. State licensing authorities, which have oversight of ALFs, are encouraged to share this guidance with all ALFs in their jurisdiction and work with state healthcare-associated infections programs to assist ALFs with implementation. Given their congregate nature and population served, assisted living facilities (ALFs) are at high risk of COVID-19 spreading and affecting their residents. If infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, assisted living residents\u2014often older adults with underlying chronic medical conditions\u2014are at increased risk of serious illness. CDC is aware of suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 among residents of ALFs in multiple states. Recent experience with outbreaks in nursing homes has also reinforced that residents with COVID-19 may not report typical symptoms such as fever or respiratory symptoms; some may not report any symptoms. Unrecognized asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections likely contribute to transmission in these settings. Because of this, CDC is recommending that the general public wear a cloth face covering for source control whenever they leave their home. Updates were also made to CDC\u2019s Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings to address universal source control for everyone in a healthcare facility. Refer to that guidance for more detailed recommendations, including when facemasks versus cloth face coverings could be used. CDC has released Interim Additional Guidance for Infection Prevention and Control for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed COVID-19 in Nursing Homes. Many of the recommended actions to prepare for COVID-19 described in that guidance also apply to ALFs. CDC has also released guidance Interim Guidance for Preventing the Spread of COVID-19 in Retirement Communities and Independent Living Facilities. However, as states are responsible for licensing and regulating ALFs, the structure and care provided within ALFs can be distinctly different from that of nursing homes. As such, implementing that guidance might present some unique challenges or additional considerations state by state. For example, the care provided in ALFs can vary greatly by the extent and type of supervision and provision of skilled nursing services. Full- or part-time nursing staff are typically not required in ALFs, and residents may receive care from contract healthcare personnel (HCP) or use outpatient providers. Because staff at many of these facilities are generally not trained to provide medical care, their access to and training to use recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) and their ability to care for residents with COVID-19 is limited. Many ALFs will not have access to an Infection Preventionist or professional nursing staff that can assist with COVID-19 preparation, prevention, and control efforts. Further, because the care and documentation of resident conditions may not be centralized within the facility, identification of a cluster or residents with fever or respiratory symptoms might be delayed. Definitions: Cloth face covering: Textile (cloth) covers that are intended to keep the person wearing one from spreading respiratory secretions when talking, sneezing, or coughing. They are not PPE and it is uncertain whether cloth face coverings protect the wearer. Guidance on design, use, and maintenance of cloth face coverings is available. Facemask: Facemasks are PPE and are often referred to as surgical masks or procedure masks. Use facemasks according to product labeling and local, state, and federal requirements. FDA-cleared surgical masks are designed to protect against splashes and sprays and are prioritized for use when such exposures are anticipated, including surgical procedures. Facemasks that are not regulated by FDA, such as some procedure masks, which are typically used for isolation purposes, may not provide protection against splashes and sprays. Respirator: A respirator is a personal protective device that is worn on the face, covers at least the nose and mouth, and is used to reduce the wearer\u2019s risk of inhaling hazardous airborne particles (including dust particles and infectious agents), gases, or vapors. Respirators are certified by the CDC/NIOSH, including those intended for use in healthcare. Refer to the Appendix for a summary of different types of respirators. To prepare for COVID-19 in their facilities, ALFs should take the following actions: Educate residents, family members, and personnel about COVID-19: Have a plan and mechanism to regularly communicate with personnel, residents, and any family members specified by the resident. Provide information about COVID-19 (including information about signs and symptoms) and strategies for managing stress and anxiety. Describe actions the facility is taking to protect residents and personnel. Describe actions residents and personnel can take to protect themselves in the facility, emphasizing the importance of social (physical) distancing, hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette, and source control. Remind residents and visitors that public health authorities have urged older adults to remain home and limit their interactions with others. Encourage residents to remain in their rooms as much as possible, practice social (physical) distancing, and not allow outside visitors to the facility. If residents leave their room or are around others, they should wear a cloth face covering (if tolerated), regardless of symptoms. If the resident does not have a cloth face cover, a facemask may be used for source control if supplies allow. Encourage residents, personnel, and visitors to remain vigilant for and immediately report fever or symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (e.g., sore throat, new or worsening cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches). Ask visitors to inform the facility if they develop fever or symptoms consistent with COVID-19 within 14 days of visiting the facility. Keep COVID-19 from entering the facility: Ask residents to not allow outside visitors until further notice. Visitor restrictions are to protect them and others in the facility who might have conditions making them more vulnerable to COVID-19. Facilitate alternative methods of communication (e.g., video conferencing). Create or review an inventory of all volunteers and personnel who provide care in the facility. Use that inventory to determine which personnel are non-essential and whose services can be delayed. This inventory can also be used to notify personnel if COVID-19 is identified in the facility. Restrict all volunteers and non-essential personnel including consultant services (e.g., barber, nail care). Post signage at all entrances and leave notices for contract service providers at all residences that discourage visitors. Signs should remind visitors and personnel to not to enter the building if they have fever or symptoms of COVID-19. Consider designating one central point of entry to the facility and establishing visitation hours if visitation must occur. As part of source control efforts, personnel should wear a facemask (or cloth face covering if facemask not available) at all times while they are in the facility. When available, facemasks are generally preferred over cloth face coverings for healthcare personnel as facemasks offer both source control and protection for the wearer against exposure to splashes and sprays of infectious material from others. If there are shortages of facemasks, facemasks should be prioritized for healthcare personnel and then for residents with symptoms of COVID-19 (as supply allows). \u00a0Guidance on extended use and reuse of facemasks is available. Cloth face coverings should NOT be worn instead of a respirator or facemask if more than source control is required. All personnel should be reminded to practice social distancing (e.g., remain at least 6 feet apart while in break rooms and common areas, cancel non-essential meetings). Designate one or more facility employees to actively screen all visitors and personnel, including essential consultant personnel, for the presence of fever and symptoms of COVID-19 before starting each shift/when they enter the building. Send visitors and personnel home if they are ill or have a fever of 100.0\u00b0F or greater. Ill personnel should be prioritized for testing. Implement sick leave policies that are flexible and non-punitive. Personnel who work in multiple locations may pose higher risk and should be encouraged to tell facilities if they have had exposure to other facilities with recognized COVID-19 cases. Ask residents not to leave the facility except for medically necessary purposes. Cancel all group field trips. Ensure residents who must leave the facility (e.g., residents receiving hemodialysis) wear their cloth face covering whenever leaving the facility. Implement recommended infection prevention and control practices: Provide access to alcohol-based hand sanitizer with 60-95% alcohol throughout the facility and keep sinks stocked with soap and paper towels. Ensure adequate cleaning and disinfection supplies are available. Provide EPA-registered disposable disinfectant wipes so that commonly used surfaces can be wiped down. Routinely (at least once per day, if possible) clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that are frequently touched in common areas. This may include cleaning surfaces and objects not ordinarily cleaned daily (e.g., door handles, faucets, toilet handles, light switches, elevator buttons, handrails, countertops, chairs, tables, remote controls, shared electronic equipment, and shared exercise equipment). Use regular cleaners, according to the directions on the label. For disinfection, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants should be effective. A list of products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19 is available hereexternal icon. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time). Cancel all group activities. Instead of communal dining, consider delivering meals to rooms, creating a \u201cgrab n\u2019 go\u201d option for residents, or staggering meal times to accommodate social distancing while dining (e.g., a single person per table). Work to implement social distancing among residents. Social distancing means people remain at least 6 feet apart to limit potential for transmission. Rapidly identify and properly respond to residents with suspected or confirmed COVID-19: Designate one or more facility employees to ensure all residents have been asked at least daily about fever and symptoms of COVID-19 (e.g., sore throat, new or worsening cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches). Implement a process or facility point of contact that residents can notify (e.g., call by phone) if they develop symptoms. If COVID-19 is identified or suspected in a resident (i.e., resident reports fever or symptoms of COVID-19), immediately isolate the resident in their room and notify the health department.Older people with COVID-19 may not show typical symptoms such as fever or respiratory symptoms. Atypical symptoms may include: new or worsening malaise, new dizziness, or diarrhea. Identification of these symptoms should prompt isolation and further evaluation for COVID-19. Additional information about clinical presentation of patients with COVID-19 is available. Encourage all residents to self-isolate, if not already doing so. Implement processes to maintain social distancing (remaining at least 6 feet apart) between all residents and personnel while still providing necessary services. For situations where close contact between any (symptomatic or asymptomatic) resident cannot be avoided, personnel should at a minimum, wear eye protection (goggles or face shield) and an N95 or higher-level respirator (or a facemask if respirators are not available or personnel are not fit tested). Cloth face coverings are not PPE and should not be used when a respirator or facemask is indicated. If personnel have direct contact with the resident, they should also wear gloves. If available, gowns are also recommended but should be prioritized for activities where splashes or sprays are anticipated or high-contact resident-care activities that provide opportunities for transfer to pathogens to hands and clothing of personnel (e.g., dressing, bathing/showering, transferring, providing hygiene, changing linens, changing briefs or assisting with toileting, device care or use, wound care). Personnel who do not interact with residents (e.g., not within 6 feet) and do not clean patient environments or equipment do not need to wear PPE. Consistent with the guidance for the general public, however, they should wear a cloth face covering for source control. Personnel who are expected to use PPE should receive training on selection and use of PPE, including demonstrating competency with putting on and removing PPE in a manner to prevent self-contamination. CDC has provided strategies for optimizing personal protective equipment (PPE) supply that describe actions facilities can take to extend their supply if, despite efforts to obtain additional PPE, there are shortages. These include strategies such as extended use or reuse of respirators, facemasks, and disposable eye protection. An ill resident might be able to remain in the facility if the resident: Is able to perform their own activities of daily living Can isolate in their room for the duration of their illness Can have meals delivered There is a mechanism for staff to regularly check on the resident (e.g., checking in by phone during each shift; visits by home health agency personnel who wear all recommended PPE) Is able to request assistance It might also be possible for ill residents who require more assistance to remain in the facility if they can remain isolated in their room, and on-site or consultant personnel can provide the level of care needed with access to all recommended PPE and training on proper selection and use. If the ill resident requires more assistance than can be safely provided by on-site or consultant personnel (e.g., home health agency), they should be transferred (in consultation with public health) to another location (e.g., alternate care site, hospital) that is equipped to adhere to recommended infection prevention and control practices. Transport personnel and the receiving facility should be notified about the suspected diagnosis prior to transfer. While awaiting transfer, symptomatic residents should wear a cloth face covering (if tolerated) and be separated from others (e.g., kept in their room with the door closed). Appropriate PPE (as described above) should be used by healthcare personnel when coming in contact with the resident. If residents are transferred to the hospital or another care setting, actively follow up with that facility and resident family members to determine if the resident was known or suspected to have COVID-19. This information will inform need for contact tracing or implementation of additional IPC recommendations.

Given the high risk of spread once COVID-19 enters a LTCF, facilities must act immediately to protect residents, families, and staff from serious illness, complications, and death. Keep COVID-19 from entering your facility: Restrict all visitors except for compassionate care situations (e.g., end-of- life). Restrict all volunteers and non-essential healthcare personnel (HCP), including consultant services (e.g., barber, hairdresser). Implement universal use of source control for everyone in the facility. Actively screen anyone entering the building (HCP, ancillary staff, vendors, consultants) for fever and symptoms of COVID-19 before starting each shift; send ill personnel home. Sick leave policies should be flexible and non-punitive. Cancel all field trips outside of the facility. Identify infections early: Actively screen all residents daily for fever and symptoms of COVID-19; if symptomatic, immediately isolate and implement appropriate Transmission-Based Precautions. Older adults with COVID-19 may not show typical symptoms such as fever or respiratory symptoms. Atypical symptoms may include new or worsening malaise, new dizziness, or diarrhea. Identification of these symptoms should prompt isolation and further evaluation for COVID-19. Notify your state or local health department immediately (<24 hours) if these occur: Severe respiratory infection causing hospitalization or sudden death Clusters (\u22653 residents and/or HCP) of respiratory infection Individuals with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 Prevent spread of COVID-19: Actions to take now: Cancel all group activities and communal dining. Enforce social distancing among residents. Ensure all residents wear a cloth face covering for source control whenever they leave their room or are around others, including whenever they leave the facility for essential medical appointments. Ensure all HCP wear a facemask or cloth face covering for source control while in the facility. Cloth face coverings are not considered personal protective equipment (PPE) because their capability to protect healthcare personnel (HCP) is unknown. Cloth face coverings should NOT be worn instead of a respirator or facemask if more than source control is required. If COVID-19 is identified in the facility, restrict all residents to their rooms and have HCP wear all recommended PPE for care of all residents (regardless of symptoms) on the affected unit (or facility-wide depending on the situation). This includes: an N95 or higher-level respirator (or facemask if a respirator is not available), eye protection, gloves, and gown. HCP should be trained on PPE use including putting it on and taking it off. This approach is recommended because of the high risk of unrecognized infection among residents. Recent experience suggests that a substantial proportion of residents could have COVID-19 without reporting symptoms or before symptoms develop. When a case is identified, public health can help inform decisions about testing asymptomatic residents on the unit or in the facility. Assess supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) and initiate measures to optimize current supply: If you anticipate or are experiencing PPE shortages, reach out to your state/local health department who can engage your local healthcare coalition. Consider extended use of respirators, facemasks, and eye protection or prioritization of gowns for certain resident care activities. Identify and manage severe illness: Designate a location to care for residents with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, separate from other residents. Monitor ill residents (including documentation of temperature and oxygen saturation) at least 3 times daily to quickly identify residents who require transfer to a higher level of care."}

Background/Purpose This document is intended for healthcare facilities that are receiving or are preparing to receive patients with suspected or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This includes healthcare facilities providing either inpatient or outpatient services. \u00a0It should be used to guide implementation of procedures at triage that can be effective at preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 virus) to patients and healthcare workers (HCWs). This document was developed based on current data on COVID-19 and experience with other respiratory viruses and will be updated as more information becomes available. 1.1 What is triage The sorting out and classificationexternal icon of patientsexternal icon or casualties to determine priority of need and proper place of treatmentexternal icon.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During infectious disease outbreaks, triage is particularly important to separate patients likely to be infected with the pathogen of concern.\u00a0 This triage SOP is developed in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and does not replace any routine clinical triage already in place in healthcare facilities (e.g. Manchester triage system or equivalent) to categorize patients into different urgency categories. 1.2 COVID-19 transmission The main route of transmission of COVID-19 is through respiratory droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes. \u00a0Any person who is in close contact with someone who has respiratory symptoms (e.g., sneezing, coughing, etc.) is at risk of being exposed to potentially infective respiratory droplets.2 \u00a0\u00a0Droplets may also land on surfaces where the virus could remain viable for several hours to days. Transmission through contact of hands with contaminated surfaces can occur following contact with the person\u2019s mucosa such as nose, mouth and eyes. 2. What patients can do before and upon arrival to a healthcare facility Inform healthcare providers if they are seeking care for respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough, fever, shortness of breath) by calling ahead of time Wear a facemask, if available, during transport and while at triage in the healthcare facility Notify triage registration desk about respiratory symptoms as soon as they arrive Wash hands at healthcare facility entrance with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub Carry paper or fabric tissues to cover mouth or nose when coughing or sneezing. Dispose paper tissues in a trash can immediately after use Maintain social distance by staying at least one meter away, whenever possible, from anyone, including anyone that is with the patient (e.g., companion or caregiver) 3. What healthcare facilities can do to minimize risk of infection among patients and healthcare workers Communicate with patients before arriving for triage Establish a hotline that: Patients can call or text notifying the facility that they are seeking care due to respiratory symptoms Can be used, if possible, as telephone consultation for patients to determine the need to visit a healthcare facility. Serves to inform patients of preventive measures to take as they come to the facility (e.g., wearing mask, having tissues to cover cough or sneeze). Provide information to the general public through local mass media such as radio, television, newspapers, and social media platforms about availability of a hotline and the signs and symptoms of COVID-19. Healthcare facilities, in conjunction with national authorities, should consider telemedicine (e.g., cell phone videoconference or teleconference) to provide clinical support without direct contact with the patient.3 Set up and equip triage Have clear signs at the entrance of the facility directing patients with respiratory symptoms to immediately report to the registration desk in the emergency department or at the unit they are seeking care (e.g., maternity, pediatric, HIV clinic) (Appendix 1). Facilities should consider having a separate registration desk for patients coming in with respiratory symptoms, especially at the emergency departments, and clear signs at the entrance directing patients to the designated registration desk. Ensure availability of facemasks and paper tissue at registration desk, as well as nearby hand hygiene stations. A bin with lid should be available at triage where patients can discard used paper tissues. Install physical barriers (e.g., glass or plastic screens) for registration desk (i.e., reception area) to limit close contact between registration desk personnel and potentially infectious patients. Ensure availability of hand hygiene stations in triage area, including waiting areas. Post visual alerts at the entrance of the facility and in strategic areas (e.g., waiting areas or elevators) about respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette and social distancing. This includes how to cover nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing and disposal of contaminated items in trash cans. (Appendix 2) Assign dedicated clinical staff (e.g. physicians or nurses) for physical evaluation of patients presenting with respiratory symptoms at triage. These staff should be trained on triage procedures, COVID-19 case definition, and appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) use (i.e., mask, eye protection, gown and gloves). Train administrative personnel working in the reception of patients on how to perform hand hygiene, maintain appropriate distance, and on how to advice patients properly on the use of facemask, hand hygiene, and separation from other patients. A standardized triage algorithm/questionnaire should be available for use and should include questions that will determine if the patient meets the COVID-19 case definition4 (Appendix 3). HCWs should be encouraged to have a high level of clinical suspicion of COVID-19 given the global pandemic. Set up a \u201crespiratory waiting area\u201d for suspected COVID-19 patients Healthcare facilities without enough single isolation rooms or those located in areas with high community transmission should designate a separate, well-ventilated area where patients at high risk* for COVID-19 can wait. This area should have benches, stalls or chairs separated by at least one meter distance. Respiratory waiting areas should have dedicated toilets and hand hygiene stations. Post clear signs informing patients of the location of \u201crespiratory waiting areas.\u201d Train the registration desk staff to direct patients immediately to these areas after registration. Provide paper tissues, alcohol-based hand rub, and trash bin with lid for the \u201crespiratory waiting area.\u201d Develop a process to reduce the amount of time patients are in the \u201crespiratory waiting area,\u201d which may include: Allocation of additional staff to triage patients at high risk for COVID-19 Setting up a notification system that allows patients to wait in a personal vehicle or outside of the facility (if medically appropriate) in a place that social distance can be maintained and be notified by phone or other remote methods when it is their turn to be evaluated. Triage process A facemask should be given to patients with respiratory symptoms as soon as they get to the facility if they do not already have one. All patients in the \u201crespiratory waiting area\u201d should wear a facemask. If facemasks are not available, provide paper tissues or request the patient to cover their nose and mouth with a scarf, bandana, or T-shirt during the entire triage process, including while in the \u201crespiratory waiting area\u201d. A homemade mask with cloth can also be used as source control, if the patient has one. Caution should be exercised as these items will become contaminated and can serve as a source of transmission to other patients or even family members. WHO\u2019s guidance should be followed by patients and family members to clean these items. (https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-on-infection-prevention-and-control-for-health-care-workers-caring-for-patients-with-suspected-or-confirmed-2019-ncovexternal icon). Follow triage protocol (Appendix 3) and immediately isolate/separate patients at high risk* for COVID-19 in single-person rooms with doors closed or designated \u201crespiratory waiting areas.\u201d Limit the number of accompanying family members in the waiting area for suspected COVID-19 patients (no one less than 18 years old unless a patient or a parent). Anyone in the \u201crespiratory waiting area\u201d should wear a facemask. Triage area, including \u201crespiratory waiting areas,\u201d should be cleaned at least twice a day with a focus on frequently touched surfaces. Cleaning can be done with 0.5% (5000ppm) chlorine or 70% alcohol for surfaces that do not tolerate chlorine (Appendix 4).5 *definition of patients at high risk for COVID-19 will change depending on where countries are in the stage of outbreak (e.g. no or limited community transmission vs. widespread community transmission). See Appendix 2 for the different epidemiologic scenarios. 4. What healthcare workers (HCWs) can do to protect themselves and their patients during triage All HCWs should adhere to Standard Precautions, which includes hand hygiene, selection of PPE based risk assessment, respiratory hygiene, clean and disinfection and injection safety practices. All HCWs should be trained on and familiar with IPC precautions (e.g. contact and droplet precautions, appropriate hand hygiene, donning and doffing of PPE) related to COVID-19. Follow appropriate PPE donning and doffing steps (Appendix 5). Perform hand hygiene frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub if your hands are not visibly dirty or with soap and water if hands are dirty. HCWs who come in contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients should wear appropriate PPE: HCWs in triage area who are conducting preliminary screening do not require PPE if they DO NOT have direct contact with the patient and MAINTAIN distance of at least one meter. Examples: HCWs at the registration desk that are asking limited questions based on triage protocol. Installation of physical barriers (e.g., glass or plastic screens) are encouraged if possible. HCWs providing facemasks or taking temperatures with infrared thermometers as long as spatial distance can be safely maintained. When physical distance is NOT feasible and yet NO direct contact with patients, use mask and eye protection (face shield or goggles). HCWs conducing physical examination of patients with respiratory symptoms should wear gowns, gloves, medical mask and eye protection (goggles or face shield). Cleaners in triage, waiting and examination areas should wear gown, heavy duty gloves, medical mask, eye protection (if risk of splash from organic material or chemical), boots or closed work shoes. HCWs who develop respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) should stay home and not perform triage or any other duties at the healthcare facility. Ensure that environmental cleaning and disinfection procedures are followed consistently and correctly (https://www.who.int/publications-detail/water-sanitation-hygiene-and-waste-management-for-covid-19) . 5. Additional considerations for triage during periods of community transmission Begin or reinforce existing alternatives to face-to-face triage and visits such as telemedicine3. Designate an area near the facility (e.g., an ancillary building or temporary structure) or identify a location in the area to be a \u201crespiratory virus evaluation center\u201d where patients with fever or respiratory symptoms can seek evaluation and care. Expand hours of operation, if possible, to limit crowding at triage during peak hours. Cancel non-urgent outpatient visits to ensure enough HCWs are available to provide support for COVID-19 clinical care, including triage services. Critical or urgent outpatient visits (e.g. infant vaccination or prenatal checkup for high-risk pregnancy) should continue, however, facilities should ensure separate/dedicated entry for patients coming for critical outpatient visits to not place them at risk of COVID-19. Consider postponing or cancelling elective procedures and surgeries depending on the local epidemiologic context. 6. References Medical Dictionary.

CDC provides technical assistance to help other countries increase their ability to prevent, detect, and respond to health threats, including COVID-19. This document is provided by CDC and is intended for use in non-US healthcare settings. Training SlidesThis slide deck is a reference for content on this page and can be used for training More 1. Overview This document provides guidance on the identification or screening of healthcare workers (HCWs)[1] and inpatients with suspected COVID-19. Rational, requirements, and considerations will be discussed for three broad case identification strategies: Passive strategies: Reporting/alerts are initiated by the data source (e.g., healthcare worker or treating clinician) based on a known set of rules or regulations. Enhanced passive strategies: Reporting/alerts are initiated by the data source with an added mechanism to prompt data collection, review, and/or reporting. Active strategies: Reporting/alerts are initiated by the centralized health authority (e.g., Ministry of Health, facility infection preventionist, facility administration) using a known set of rules or regulations. To support the activities for these strategies, this document provides an initial discussion on the importance of defining the signs/symptoms of persons with COVID-19, general best practices, and surveillance capacities. 2. Signs and Symptoms Consistent with COVID-19 Uncertainty remains in defining a generalizable set of characteristic signs and symptoms for COVID-19. At best, current evidence suggests substantial variability ranging from mild to severe and based on only partially described patient-level factors. The most commonly reported signs and symptoms in the current literature include: Fever Cough Shortness of breath However, additional non-specific or atypical symptoms include: Sore throat Diarrhea Myalgia (muscle aches, body aches) Tiredness or fatigue Further, elderly patients may present differently than younger populations. Given these limitations, facilities should define a standardized set of signs and symptoms (e.g., fever and/or cough/shortness of breath) to screen HCWs and patients for suspected COVID-19. A high level of suspicion is critical to ensure cases do not go unrecognized due to likely substantial proportion of patients and healthcare workers presenting with atypical or minimal symptoms. 3. General Best Practices In addition to a specific strategy for the identification of suspected COVID-19 cases, there are general best practices that will improve both healthcare worker and inpatient COVID-19 screening. Some examples include: Train and Educate Healthcare Workers Provide healthcare workers with job- or task-specific education and training on identifying and preventing transmission of infectious agents, including refresher training Ensure that healthcare workers are educated, trained, and have practiced the appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) prior to caring for a patient Provide job-aids and up-to-date reference materials Encourage and support a high index of suspicion in healthcare workers regarding suspect COVID-19 cases Monitor and Manage Ill and Exposed Healthcare Workers Facilities and organizations providing healthcare should implement sick leave policies for healthcare workers that are non-punitive, flexible, and consistent with public health guidance Movement and monitoring decisions for healthcare workers with exposure to COVID-19 should be made in consultation with public health authorities Establish Reporting within and between Healthcare Facilities and to Public Health Authorities Implement mechanisms and policies that promote situational awareness for facility staff about confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients and facility plans for response, including: Infection control Healthcare epidemiology Facility leadership Occupational health Clinical laboratory Frontline staff Communicate and collaborate with public health authorities Communicate information about confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients to appropriate personnel before transferring to other departments in the facility and to other healthcare facilities 4. Surveillance Capacities Facility-based surveillance for healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), including infections in healthcare workers and inpatients, is one of the WHO\u2019s eight core components of infection prevention and control.\u00a0 While surveillance is a critical component of providing safe healthcare, it is important to recognize that it requires expertise, good quality data, and an established infection prevention and control (IPC) program and thus, may require time to set up[2]. \u00a0For this reason, during public health emergency response, healthcare facilities are encouraged to initially implement facility-based suspect COVID-19 patient case finding (surveillance) feasible with existing surveillance capacities. Health facility surveillance capacity varies greatly even within health systems.\u00a0 A realistic appraisal of capacity can help identify the best strategy for a given context.\u00a0 A general description of surveillance capacities based on existing HAI surveillance activity is provided for guidance. Surveillance Capacities Surveillance Capacity Standardized HAI case definitions / methods Dedicated surveillance staff3 Patient-level data available / accessible High: Resources needed for detailed patient interviews and/or chart reviews are readily available YES YES YES Medium: Some experience with standardized data collection with limitation in staff and data availability YES PARTIAL PARTIAL Low to Very Low: Little to no experience with patient-level collection of standardized data, limited availability of staff and data for reassignment for case finding activities PARTIAL NO NO 5. Identification of Healthcare workers with suspected COVID-19 Objective:\u00a0 Prevent exposure of at-risk patients and staff to symptomatic COVID-19 positive healthcare workers. Figure: Passive identification of healthcare workers with suspected COVID-19 Passive strategy All healthcare workers self-assess for fever and/or a defined set of newly present symptoms indicative of COVID-19.\u00a0 If fever or respiratory symptoms are present, healthcare workers: Remotely report this information4 Do not report to their health facility Are provided with immediate medical assessment and follow-up actions Rationale: Establishes mechanisms for the identification of healthcare workers at increased likelihood of infection with minimal resource requirements. Requirements: List of symptoms and thermometer for self-assessment. Staff and mechanism (e.g., telephone line) for remote reporting of fever and/or presence of symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Ideally this system is always available for quick medical assessment.5 Decision algorithms for response to healthcare worker reports and the results of secondary assessment. Standardized medical assessment and movement and monitoring forms. Considerations: Adherence is highly dependent on healthcare worker motivation and appropriate self-assessment of risk. Can result in reduction in work force, particularly among some critical staffing categories. Provision of paid sick leave/compensation for all healthcare workers not allowed to work is often critical for success, requiring substantial resources. Figure: Enhanced passive identification of healthcare workers with suspected COVID-19 Enhanced passive strategy In addition to passive strategy, establish a plan to remind or prompt workers to self-assess for symptoms consistent with COVID-19.\u00a0 Common reminders include automated text messages or phone calls. Rationale: Evidence suggests that simple automatic reminders can increase adherence. Requirements: All requirements of Passive Strategy Automated (e.g., mass texting service) or manual system (e.g., direct messaging or phone calls) to contact healthcare workers as prompt for self-assessment Requirements (Automated System): Mass Text Messaging Services capable of sending SMS (short message service) messages to groups of people simultaneously. Mass Text Messaging Services are sometimes provided by independent internet-based service companies or, in some settings, are provided by cellular service providers. Database of contacts (i.e., healthcare workers under monitoring). In addition to contact number, database fields may include name, position, work unit/area, and monitoring end date. An effective and informative mass text message including frequency of messaging, timing of delivery, and any interactivity of interventions6. Requirements (Manual System): Database of contacts (i.e., healthcare workers under monitoring). Because of the effort required in manual systems, this database should be carefully targeted to minimize workload and maximize benefit.\u00a0 Considerations for targeting might include: Healthcare workers with documented COVID-19 exposure Healthcare workers serving a population at high-risk of COVID-19 complication Staff available to contact monitored healthcare workers with reminders. Phone and phone credit to support messaging and or calls. Considerations: Same as Passive Strategy Funding may be required to support bulk text messaging Figure: Active identification of healthcare workers with suspected COVID-19 Active strategies In-person active strategy All healthcare workers present for in-person evaluation of symptoms and fever prior to each shift.\u00a0 If symptoms consistent of COVID-19 are reported or observed, healthcare workers are provided with immediate follow-up actions. Remote active strategy All healthcare workers report (e.g., by call or text) the absence or presence of symptoms consistent with COVID-19 remotely each day.\u00a0 Staff that fail to report or report symptoms are followed up. Rationale: While there is limited evidence for the benefit of active healthcare worker monitoring, active strategies will theoretically result in increased healthcare worker adherence to self-evaluation of symptoms, thus enhancing patient protection. Requirements (In-person active strategy): All requirements of Passive Strategy Dedicated staff to evaluate healthcare workers before their shift (active) or respond and monitor healthcare worker reports Physical area for staff evaluations that will allow recommended social distancing (i.e., at least one-meter) and includes adequate hand hygiene stations (soap and running water or alcohol-based hand rub) No touch thermometers Implementation plan that includes a method to ensure that staff present at a given place for pre-shift evaluation Accountability system to ensure all healthcare workers have been evaluated (e.g., work slip sign off) Requirements (Remote Active Strategy): All requirements of Passive Strategy Accountability system to ensure all healthcare workers report in remotely prior to their work shift Considerations: Same as Passive Strategy. Active monitoring of healthcare workers can be highly resource intensive. There is limited evidence of increased effectiveness in prevention of nosocomial transmission beyond passive strategies. Acceptance by staff can be limited by perceptions of mistrust in ability to monitor and appropriately report symptoms. Active monitoring can decrease the likelihood that healthcare workers self-monitor signs and symptoms. Ideally, healthcare workers are checking their own temperature and symptoms and will not present if not indicated. Any action that weakens self-monitoring should be implemented with caution. To decrease workload, and if accountability can be maintained, the following can be delegated to unit/immediate supervisors (e.g., head/charge nurses, department heads): responsibility for receiving symptom/temperature reports monitoring staff compliance for the remote active strategy 6. Identification of Inpatients with suspected COVID-19 The development of acute respiratory infection and healthcare-associated pneumonia are common complications of hospitalization. However, it is important that clinicians maintain a high level of suspicion for COVID-19 when there is a compatible presentation.\u00a0 Because healthcare facilities often represent a gathering of individuals at higher risk of infection and adverse outcome, the potential of outbreak and harm to patients requires special effort to ensure any inpatient COVID-19 cases are identified. A goal of identifying inpatients with suspected COVID-19 is to guide infection prevention and control (IPC) strategies to prevent or limit transmission in healthcare setting.\u00a0 See interim WHO guidance hereexternal icon7. Figure: Passive strategy for identification of inpatients with suspected COVID-19 Passive Strategy: Clinicians are kept informed8 on: Current COVID-19 case definitions Latest description of COVID-19 clinical presentation Relevant local epidemiology, including at risk groups and association with travel or area of residence Facility COVID-19 admission triage, and cohorting practices Clinicians are also made aware of what to do if they suspect COVID-19 in a hospitalized patient, including isolation precautions, PPE use, reporting/informing IPC focal point at the facility and public health authorities, and how to obtain testing, if available Recommended Surveillance Capacity Level: Applicable at all HAI surveillance capacity levels (i.e., Very Low to High) Rationale: Minimal disruption of existing clinical practice and no requirement for standardized data collection or form completion. Strategy seeks to encourage recognition and reporting by astute clinicians. Requirements: Regular and up-to-date educational materials/job aids provided to and accessible by clinicians COVID-19 case definitions9 Standard operating procedure (SOP) for response to identified suspect case patients (e.g., isolation, cohorting, PPE). See WHO interim guidance (hereexternal icon) for recommendations Acceptable reporting/communication channels to hospital administration and public health authorities Considerations: Strategy is dependent on participation and skill of available clinicians and an understanding of local epidemiology and clinical presentation of COVID-19, which may differ in different populations. Limited to no access for diagnostic testing will complicate this effort with the most conservative strategy being to treat all suspect cases as confirmed cases (empirical case determination) \u2013 potentially wasting resources, and if cases are cohorted, mixing positive and negative patients for extended periods. The degree of resource waste and case patient mixing will depend on the accuracy of empirical case determination. Supporting empirical case determination through clinician education and job aids (as described) can help improve accuracy of clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Figure: Enhanced passive strategy for identification of inpatients with suspected COVID-19 Enhanced Passive Strategy: Enhancement of the passive strategy can be achieved through establishing systems that prompt or require clinicians to regularly review all patients as to their likelihood of harboring COVID-19.\u00a0 Example enhanced passive strategies might include: Incorporating consideration of COVID-19 into sign out reporting Requiring units to provide a daily clinician-generated list of suspected cases, including if there are zero cases Specific daily request to clinicians to report and discuss encountered patients with symptoms/history consistent with COVID-19 Recommended Surveillance Capacity Level: Applicable in most HAI surveillance capacity levels (very low to high) Rationale: Dialog and accountability for case finding and reporting can improve empirical case determination, ensure patient evaluations are not missed, and help avoid clinician complacency over the long term Requirements: All requirements of Passive Strategy Strategy to prompt and/or ensure clinician review \u2013 Requirements will depend on selected strategy Considerations: Effective strategies will be context specific \u2013 requiring thought and effort in design and implementation May represent changes in current practice limiting acceptability Figure: Active strategy for identification of inpatients with suspected COVID-19 Active Strategy: Active case identification involves targeted data collection and review of patient information by groups specifically responsible for the identification of suspected COVID-19 cases.\u00a0 Examples of groups responsible for case identification and active case identification may include: Ministries of Health Sub-national/local public health authorities Facility infection prevention and control teams Recommended Surveillance Capacity Level: High existing surveillance capacity or medium capacity with the provision of additional resources Rationale: Smaller more centralized team responsible for case identification can increase overall quality through dedicated training, improved engagement, limiting of competing priorities, and standardization of methods Requirements: Team with the information access, resources, and experience necessary for systematic review of patient information in order to appropriately apply standardized suspect case definitions Group(s) with availability and responsibility for data collection, analysis/presentation, and information sharing Group(s) with availability and responsibility for review of case-finding information with the authority and willingness to take appropriate action Considerations: Highly resource intensive Teams with the requisite skills can be difficult to build during outbreak response periods Separates case finding activities from patient care activities, which can decrease acceptability and impact sustainability Value of active inpatient case finding, especially the context of limited diagnostic testing, should be carefully considered 7. Case Definitions REFER TO WHO HEREexternal icon FOR CURRENT COVID-19 SURVEILLANCE AND CASE DEFINITIONS Suspected Case Definitions Suspected Case Definitions A.\u00a0Symptoms + Travel History B.\u00a0Symptoms + Epidemiologic Link C.\u00a0Severe Symptoms A patient with ALL of the following: acute respiratory illness no other etiology that fully explains the clinical presentation a history of travel to or residence in a country, area or territory that has reported local transmission of COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset A patient with ALL of the following: any acute respiratory illness contact of a confirmed or probable case of COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms A patient with ALL of the following: severe acute respiratory infection requires hospitalization no other etiology that fully explains the clinical presentation See: https://www.who.int/publications-detail/global-surveillance-for-human-infection-with-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)external icon for details. Confirmed Case Definition Currently, a confirmed case is a person with laboratory confirmation of infection with the COVID-19 virus, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms. Considerations If testing is unavailable or severely limited, confirmed case counts will not reflect the true burden of disease. In this situation, caution should be used in using case counts for decision making. Suspected Case Definition C. (Severe Symptoms) is applicable for inpatient case finding but may identify a substantial proportion of false positives. Especially when diagnostic testing is limited, the value of assessing travel history and epidemiological links/contact may be of value.

Clinicians considering testing people with possible COVID-19 should\u00a0 work with their local and state health departments to coordinate testing through public health laboratories, or work with commercial or clinical laboratories using diagnostic tests granted an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. CDC has guidance\u00a0for who should be tested, but decisions about testing are at the discretion of state and local health departments and/or individual clinicians. Healthcare providers should report positive results to their local/state health department. Clinical laboratories should NOT attempt viral isolation from specimens collected from people suspected to have COVID-19 unless this is performed in a BSL-3 laboratory.\u00a0Testing for other\u00a0pathogens by the provider should be done as part of the initial evaluation but should not delay testing for SARS-CoV-2. Specimen Type and Priority All testing for SARS-CoV-2 should be conducted in consultation with a healthcare provider. Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs can be used for testing asymptomatic persons in a healthcare setting, including long-term care facilities. At this time anterior nares and mid-turbinate specimen collection are only appropriate for symptomatic patients and both nares should be swabbed. The guidance below addresses options for collection of specimens once a clinical determination has been made to pursue SARS-CoV-2 testing. For initial diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2, CDC recommends collecting and testing an upper respiratory specimen. Nasopharyngeal specimen is the preferred choice for swab-based SARS-CoV-2 testing. When collection of a nasopharyngeal swab is not possible, the following are acceptable alternatives: An oropharyngeal (OP) specimen collected by a healthcare professional, or A nasal mid-turbinate (NMT) swab collected by a healthcare professional or by onsite self-collection (using a flocked tapered swab), or An anterior nares (nasal swab; NS) specimen collected by a healthcare professional or by onsite self-collection (using a flocked or spun polyester swab) Nasopharyngeal wash/aspirate or nasal aspirate (NA) specimen collected by a healthcare professional For NS, a single polyester swab with a plastic shaft should be used to sample both nares. NS or NMT swabs should be placed in a transport tube containing either viral transport medium, Amies transport medium, or sterile saline. See the standard operating procedure for public health labs to create viral transport mediumpdf icon\u00a0in accordance with CDC\u2019s protocol. If both NP and OP swabs are collected, they should be combined in a single tube to maximize test sensitivity and limit use of testing resources. CDC also recommends testing lower respiratory tract specimens, if available. For patients who develop a productive cough, sputum should be collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2. The induction of sputum is not recommended. When it is clinically indicated (e.g., those receiving invasive mechanical ventilation), a lower respiratory tract aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage sample should be collected and tested as a lower respiratory tract specimen. Specimens should be collected as soon as possible once a decision has been made to pursue SARS-CoV-2 testing, regardless of the time of symptom onset. Maintain proper infection control and use recommended personal protective equipment, which includes an N95 or higher-level respirator (or facemask if a respirator is not available), eye protection, gloves, and a gown, when collecting specimens. See Biosafety FAQs\u00a0for handling and processing specimens from suspected case patients. General Guidelines Proper collection of specimens is the most important step in the laboratory diagnosis of infectious disease. A specimen that is not collected correctly may lead to false negative test results. The following specimen collection guidelines follow standard recommended procedures. I. Respiratory Specimens A. Upper respiratory tract Nasopharyngeal (NP) swab/oropharyngeal (OP) swab Use only synthetic fiber swabs with plastic shafts. Do not use calcium alginate swabs or swabs with wooden shafts, as they may contain substances that inactivate some viruses and inhibit PCR testing. Place swabs immediately into sterile tubes containing 2-3 mL of viral transport media.\u00a0In general CDC is now recommending collecting only the NP swab.\u00a0If both swabs are used, NP and OP specimens should be combined at collection into a single vial. OP swabs remain an acceptable specimen type. Nasopharyngeal swab: Insert flexible wire shaft minitip swab through the nares parallel to the palate (not upwards) until resistance is encountered or the distance is equivalent to that from the ear to the nostril of the patient, indicating contact with the nasopharynx. Swab should reach depth equal to distance from nostrils to outer opening of the ear. Gently rub and roll the swab. Leave swab in place for several seconds to absorb secretions. Slowly remove swab while rotating it. Oropharyngeal swab (e.g., throat swab): Insert swab into the posterior pharynx and tonsillar areas. \u00a0Rub swab over both tonsillar pillars and posterior oropharynx and avoid touching the tongue, teeth, and gums. Nasopharyngeal wash/aspirate or nasal aspirate (NA) Attach catheter to suction apparatus. Have the patient sit with head tilted slightly backward. Instill 1 mL-1.5 mL of non-bacteriostatic saline (pH 7.0) into one nostril. Insert the tubing into the nostril parallel to the palate (not upwards). Catheter should reach depth equal to distance from nostrils to outer opening of ear. Begin gentle suction/aspiration and remove catheter while rotating it gently. Place specimen in a sterile viral transport media tube. Nasal mid-turbinate (NMT) swab, also called Deep Nasal Swab Use a flocked tapered swab. Tilt patient\u2019s head back 70 degrees. While gently rotating the swab, insert swab less than one inch (about 2 cm) into nostril (until resistance is met at turbinates). Rotate the swab several times against nasal wall and repeat in other nostril using the same swab. For more information, see the CDC Influenza Specimen Collectionpdf icon\u00a0instructions. Note that these instructions are applicable for respiratory viruses in general, and not specific for influenza virus. Anterior nares specimen (NS) Using a flocked or spun polyester swab, insert the swab at least 1 cm (0.5 inch) inside the nares and firmly sample the nasal membrane by rotating the swab and leaving in place for 10 to 15 seconds. Sample both nares with same swab. B. Lower respiratory tract Bronchoalveolar lavage, tracheal aspirate, pleural fluid, lung biopsy Collect 2-3 mL into a sterile, leak-proof, screw-cap sputum collection cup or sterile dry container. Due to the increased technical skill and equipment needs, collection of specimens other than sputum from the lower respiratory tract may be limited to patients presenting with more severe disease, including people admitted to the hospital and/or fatal cases. Sputum Educate the patient about the difference between sputum and oral secretions (saliva). Have the patient rinse the mouth with water and then expectorate deep cough sputum directly into a sterile, leak-proof, screw-cap collection cup or sterile dry container. II. Storage Store specimens at 2-8\u00b0C for up to 72 hours after collection. If a delay in testing or shipping is expected, store specimens at -70\u00b0C or below. III. Shipping Specimens must be packaged, shipped, and transported according to the current edition of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) Dangerous Goods Regulations external icon. If shipping samples to CDC:\u00a0 If specimens will ship without delay, store specimens at 2-8\u00b0C, and ship overnight to CDC on ice pack. If a delay in shipping will result in receipt at CDC more than 72 hours after collection, store specimens at -70\u00b0C or below and ship overnight to CDC on dry ice. Additional useful and detailed information on packing, shipping, and transporting specimens can be found at Interim Laboratory Biosafety Guidelines for Handling and Processing Specimens Associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Samples may be shipped to CDC if repeated testing results remain inconclusive or if other unusual results are obtained. Please contact CDC at respvirus@cdc.gov\u00a0prior to submitting samples. Label each specimen container with the patient\u2019s ID number (e.g., medical record number), unique CDC or state-generated nCov specimen ID (e.g., laboratory requisition number), specimen type (e.g., serum) and the date the sample was collected.

When transporting a known confirmed positive passenger, it is recommended that drivers wear an N95 respirator or facemask (if a respirator is not available) and eye protection such as a face shield or goggles (as long as they do not create a driving hazard), and the passenger should wear a facemask or cloth face covering. Occupants of these vehicles should avoid or limit close contact (within 6 feet) with others. The use of larger vehicles such as vans is recommended when feasible to allow greater social (physical) distance between vehicle occupants. Additionally, drivers should practice regular hand hygiene, avoid touching their nose, mouth, or eyes, and avoid picking up multiple passengers who would not otherwise be riding together on the same route. CDC recommends that individuals wear cloth face coverings in settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain, especially in areas with significant community transmission. Cloth face coverings may prevent people who don\u2019t know they have the virus from transmitting it to others; these face coverings are not surgical masks, respirators, or personal protective equipment (PPE). Cloth face coverings should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance. The following are general guidelines for cleaning and disinfecting these vehicles. Similar guidance can be found for cleaning and disinfecting homes, community facilities, and EMS vehicles used to transport persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. At a minimum, clean and disinfect commonly touched surfaces in the vehicle at the beginning and end of each shift and between transporting passengers who are visibly sick. Ensure that cleaning and disinfection procedures are followed consistently and correctly, including the provision of adequate ventilation when chemicals are in use. Doors and windows should remain open when cleaning the vehicle. When cleaning and disinfecting, individuals should wear disposable gloves compatible with the products being used as well as any other PPE required according to the product manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Use of a disposable gown is also recommended, if available. For hard non-porous surfaces within the interior of the vehicle such as hard seats, arm rests, door handles, seat belt buckles, light and air controls, doors and windows, and grab handles, clean with detergent or soap and water if the surfaces are visibly dirty, prior to disinfectant application. For disinfection of hard, non-porous surfaces, appropriate disinfectants include: EPA\u2019s Registered Antimicrobial Products for Use Against Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2external icon, the virus that causes COVID-19. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for concentration, application method, and contact time for all cleaning and disinfection products. Diluted household bleach solutions prepared according to the manufacturer\u2019s label for disinfection, if appropriate for the surface. Follow manufacturer\u2019s instructions for application and proper ventilation. Check to ensure the product is not past its expiration date. Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser. Alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol. For soft or porous surfaces such as fabric seats, remove\u202fany visible contamination, if present,\u202fand clean with appropriate cleaners indicated for use on these surfaces. After cleaning, use products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19external icon and that are suitable for porous surfaces. For frequently touched electronic surfaces, such as tablets or touch screens used in the vehicle, remove visible dirt, then disinfect following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products. If no manufacturer guidance is available, consider the use of alcohol-based wipes or sprays containing at least 70% alcohol to disinfect. Gloves and any other disposable PPE used for cleaning and disinfecting the vehicle should be removed and disposed of after cleaning; wash hands immediately after removal of gloves and PPE with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available. If a disposable gown was not worn, work uniforms/clothes worn during cleaning and disinfecting should be laundered afterwards using the warmest appropriate water setting and dry items completely. Wash hands after handling laundry."}

People who are infected often have symptoms of illness. Some people without symptoms may be able to spread virus. COVID-19 is a new disease and\u00a0we are still learning about how it spreads\u00a0and the severity of illness it causes. Person-to-person spread The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person. Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Some recent studies have suggested that COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms. Maintaining good social distance (about 6 feet) is very important in preventing the spread of COVID-19. Spread from contact with contaminated surfaces or objects It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. This is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads, but we are still learning more about this virus. Wash your hands often with soap and water. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub. Also, routinely clean frequently touched surfaces. How easily the virus spreads How easily a virus spreads from person-to-person can vary. Some viruses are highly contagious, like measles, while other viruses do not spread as easily. Another factor is whether the spread is sustained, which means it goes from person-to-person without stopping. The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading very easily and sustainably between people. Information from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic suggest that this virus is spreading more efficiently than influenza, but not as efficiently as measles, which is highly contagious.

While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date. Children may have mild symptoms The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults. However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally shown mild symptoms. Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough. Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported. It\u2019s not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs. There is more to learn about how the disease impacts children. You can learn more about who is most at risk for health problems if they have COVID-19 infection on Are You at Higher Risk for Severe Illness. Help stop the spread of COVID-19 Take steps to protect children and others from getting sick Help stop the spread of COVID-19 by doing the same things everyone should do to stay healthy. Teach your children to do the same. Clean hands often using soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Avoid people who are sick (coughing and sneezing). Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces daily in household common areas (like tables, hard-backed chairs, doorknobs, light switches, remotes, handles, desks, toilets, and sinks). Launder items including washable plush toys as needed. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. If possible, launder items using the warmest appropriate water setting\u00a0 and dry items completely. Dirty laundry from an ill person can be washed with other people\u2019s items. You can find additional information on preventing COVID-19 at How to Protect Yourself\u00a0and at Preventing COVID-19 Spread in Communities. Additional information on how COVID-19 is spread is available at How COVID-19 Spreads. Related: Talking to Children About COVID-19 Limit time with other children Practice social distancing The key to slowing the spread of COVID-19 is to limit contact as much as possible. While school is out, children should not have in-person playdates with children from other households. If children are playing outside their own homes, it is essential that they remain 6 feet from anyone who is not in their own household. To help children maintain social connections while social distancing, help your children have supervised phone calls or video chats with their friends. Clean hands often Make sure children practice everyday preventive behaviors, such as washing their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. This is especially important if you have been in a public place. Change spring break & travel plans Revise spring break and travel plans if they included non-essential travel. If children meet in groups, it can put everyone at risk. Children with COVID-19 may only have mild symptoms, but they can still pass this virus onto others who may be at higher risk, including older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions. Limit time with older adults and people with serious underlying medical conditions Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions are at highest risk of severe illness from COVID-19. If others in your home are at particularly high risk for severe illness from COVID-19, consider extra precautions to separate your child from those people. If you are unable to stay home with your child while school is out, carefully consider who might be best positioned to provide child care. If someone at higher risk for COVID-19 will be providing care (older adult, such as a grandparent or someone with a chronic medical condition), limit your children\u2019s contact with other people. Consider postponing visits or trip to see older family members and grandparents. Connect virtually or by writing letters and sending via mail. Children 2 years and older should wear a cloth face covering Children 2 years and older should wear a cloth face covering their nose and mouth when in the community setting. This is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions. A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others. This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms. Medical masks and N-95 respirators are still reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance. Keep children healthy Watch your child for any signs of illness If you see any sign of illness consistent with symptoms of COVID-19, particularly fever, cough, or shortness of breath, call your healthcare provider and keep your child at home and away from others as much as possible. Follow CDC\u2019s guidance on what to do if you are sick. Watch for signs of stress in your child Some common changes to watch for include excessive worry or sadness, unhealthy eating or sleeping habits, and difficulty with attention and concentration. For more information, see the \u201cFor Parents\u201d section of CDC\u2019s Stress and Coping. Take time to talk with your child or teen about the COVID-19 outbreak. Answer questions and share facts\u00a0about COVID-19 in a way that your child or teen can understand. Go to CDC\u2019s Helping Children Cope with Emergencies or Talking with Children About COVID-19\u00a0for more information. Teach and reinforce everyday preventive actions Parents and caretakers play an important role in teaching children to wash their hands. Explain that hand washing can keep them healthy and stop the virus from spreading to others. Be a good role model\u2014if you wash your hands often, they\u2019re more likely to do the same. Make handwashing a family activity. Learn more about handwashing and other everyday preventive actions. Help your child stay active Encourage your child to play outdoors\u2014it\u2019s great for physical and mental health. Take a walk with your child or go on a bike ride. Use indoor activity breaks (like stretch breaks or dance breaks) throughout the day to help your child stay healthy and focused. Help your child stay socially connected Reach out to friends and family via phone or video chats. Write cards or letters to family members they may not be able to visit. Some schools and non-profits, such as the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learningexternal icon and The Yale Center for Emotional Intelligenceexternal icon, have resources for social and emotional learning. Check to see if your school has tips and guidelines to help support social and emotional needs of your child. Ask about school meal services Check with your school on plans to continue meal services during the school dismissal. Many schools are keeping school facilities open to allow families to pick up meals or are providing grab-and-go meals at a central location. Help children continue learning Stay in touch with your child\u2019s school Many schools are offering lessons online (virtual learning). Review assignments from the school, and help your child establish a reasonable pace for completing the work. You may need to assist your child with turning on devices, reading instructions, and typing answers. Communicate challenges to your school. If you face technology or connectivity issues, or if your child is having a hard time completing assignments, let the school know. Create a flexible schedule and routine for learning at home Have consistent bedtimes and get up at the same time, Monday through Friday. Structure the day for learning, free time, healthy meals and snacks, and physical activity. Allow flexibility in the schedule\u2014it\u2019s okay to adapt based on your day. Consider the needs and adjustment required for your child\u2019s age group The transition to being at home will be different for preschoolers, K-5, middle school students, and high school students. Talk to your child about expectations and how they are adjusting to being at home versus at school. Consider ways your child can stay connected with their friends without spending time in person. Look for ways to make learning fun Have hands-on activities, like puzzles, painting, drawing, and making things. Independent play can also be used in place of structured learning. Encourage children to build a fort from sheets or practice counting by stacking blocks. Practice handwriting and grammar by writing letters to family members. This is a great way to connect and limit face-to-face contact. Start a journal with your child to document this time and discuss the shared experience. Use audiobooks or see if your local library is hosting virtual or live-streamed reading events.

Some cause illness in people, and others cause illness in certain types of animals. Some coronaviruses that infect animals can sometimes be spread to people, but this is rare. We do not know the exact source of the current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The first infections were thought to be linked to a live animal market, but the virus is now primarily spreading from person to person. The first case of an animal testing positive for the virus in the United States was a tiger that had a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City. We do not have evidence that companion animals, including pets, can spread the virus that causes COVID-19 to people or that they might be a source of infection in the United States. CDC is aware of a very small number of pets outside the United States reportedexternal icon to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 after close contact with people with COVID-19. Treat pets as you would other human family members \u2013 do not let pets interact with people or animals outside the household.

Homeless services are often provided in congregate settings, which could facilitate the spread of infection.\u00a0Because many people who are homeless are older adults or have underlying medical conditions, they may also be at higher risk for severe disease. Health departments and healthcare facilities should be aware that people who are homeless are a particularly vulnerable group. If possible, identifying non-congregate settings where those at highest risk can stay may help protect them from COVID-19. How people experiencing homelessness can protect themselves Many of the recommendations to prevent COVID-19 may be difficult for a person experiencing homelessness to do. Although it may not be possible to avoid certain crowded locations (such as shelters), people who are homeless should: Try to avoid other crowded public settings and public transportation. If possible, use take-away options for food. Maintain a distance of 6 feet (about two arms\u2019 length) from other people. Wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds as often as possible, and cover their coughs and sneezes. If people experiencing homelessness have symptoms Any person experiencing homelessness with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 \u00a0(fever, cough, or shortness of breath) should alert their service providers (such as case managers, shelter staff, and other care providers). These staff will help the individual understand how to isolate themselves and identify options for medical care as needed. How to get tested for COVID-19 If they meet criteria for testing, people experiencing homelessness will access COVID-19 testing\u00a0through a healthcare provider. Local public health and healthcare facilities need to determine the best location for this testing in coordination with homeless healthcare clinics and street medicine clinics. Anyone sick with COVID-19 should stay isolated Those with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should stay in a place where they can\u00a0best be isolated from other people\u00a0to prevent spreading the infection. Local health departments, housing authorities, homeless service systems, and healthcare facilities should plan to identify locations to isolate those with known or suspected COVID-19 until they meet the criteria to end isolation. Isolation housing could be units designated by local authorities or shelters determined to have capacity to sufficiently isolate these people. If no other options are available, homeless service providers\u00a0should plan for how they can help people isolate themselves while efforts are underway to provide additional support. Donations of food and clothing to homeless service providers Homeless service providers can accept donations of food and clothing during community spread of COVID-19, but general infection control precautions should be taken. Request that donors not donate if they are sick. Set up donation drop-off points to encourage social distancing\u00a0between shelter workers and those donating. Launder donated clothing, sheets, towels, or other fabrics on high heat settings, and disinfect items that are nonporous, such as items made of plastic. Food donations should be shelf-stable, and shelter staff should take usual food-related infection prevention precautionsexternal icon. Screening of incoming guests at homeless shelters Homeless shelters can screen incoming guests for symptoms of respiratory infections. Any person with symptoms of COVID-19 should be provided with a facemask, if available. They should then be directed to a predetermined area. This may be an alternate location or an area within the shelter. Ideally, these guests would stay in individual rooms. If individual rooms are not available, consider using a large, well-ventilated room where beds at least 6 feet apart with temporary barriers between them. Request that all guests sleep head-to-toe. At this time, it is not recommended to screen incoming guests for COVID-19 using laboratory tests unless directed to do so by local health authorities. Keeping open homeless shelters and encampments Homeless shelters serve a critical function in our communities.\u00a0Shelters should stay open\u00a0unless homeless service providers, health departments, and housing authorities have determined together that a shelter needs to close. Connecting people to stable housing should continue to be a priority. However, if individual housing options are not available, allow people who are living in encampments to remain where they are. Encourage people living in encampments to\u00a0increase space between people and provide hygiene resources. More details: Interim Guidance for Homeless Service Providers"}

More information on Are you at higher risk for serious illness? Know How it Spreads There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person. Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Some recent studies have suggested that COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms. More details: How COVID-19 Spreads Everyone Should Clean your hands often Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.

Remember that some people without symptoms may be able to spread virus. Keeping distance from others is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick. Cover your mouth and nose with a cloth face cover when around others You could spread COVID-19 to others even if you do not feel sick. Everyone should wear a cloth face cover when they have to go out in public, for example to the grocery store or to pick up other necessities. Cloth face coverings should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance. The cloth face cover is meant to protect other people in case you are infected. Do NOT use a facemask meant for a healthcare worker. Continue to keep about 6 feet between yourself and others. The cloth face cover is not a substitute for social distancing. More details: Cloth Face Covers Cover coughs and sneezes If you are in a private setting and do not have on your cloth face covering, remember to always cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow. Throw used tissues in the trash. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Clean and disinfect Clean AND disinfect frequently touched surfaces\u00a0daily. This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks. If surfaces are dirty, clean them.

Everyone has a role to play to reduce and slow the transmission of COVID-19. Social distancing is an essential step in preventing the spread of COVID-19. Social distancing is reducing physical interaction between people and it lowers the chances of spreading illness between people. Practice social distancing by putting space (at least 6 feet) between yourself and others. It is especially important during the COVID-19 pandemic to protect people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. These people include older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions.\u00a0 People can follow social distancing by reducing how often they are physically near others, reducing the overall number of people they are physically near, and by keeping at least 6 feet away from others when they do leave their homes.\u00a0 Staying physically apart is important, even in places like the workplace, school, when shopping, or in other places in your community. The goal of social distancing is to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19. How can I Cope with Social Distancing During the COVID-19 Pandemic? Social distancing may make some people feel socially or culturally isolated, and possibly lead to loneliness, depression and poor health. It is important to use other non-physical ways to connect with family and friends, like sending a letter, phone calls, video calls, or social media. Exercising in or around your home or yard and sitting or working outside, close to home, can also help. Social distancing to stay healthy and safe may prevent people from following some traditional and ceremonial practices. This may be especially relevant for American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities, but it is very important to use social distancing to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Below are some ways to cope with social distancing and the stress COVID-19 may cause: Take breaks from watching, reading, or listening to news stories, including social media. Hearing about the pandemic continuously can be upsetting. Take care of your body and mind. Take deep breaths, meditate, stretch, and exercise regularly. Try to eat healthy, well-balanced meals. Get plenty of sleep. Avoid alcohol and drugs. Connect with others online or on the phone and talk with people you trust about your concerns and how you are feeling. Make time to relax and do activities you enjoy that can be done while social distancing. People who need help or know someone that needs help with stress or anxiety can contact the Disaster Distress Helpline external iconat 1-800-985-5990, or talk to a counselor or social worker that may be available in your area. Preparing your Family and Household for COVID-19 AI/AN communities with multi-generational households or those in rural or tribal areas may experience unique challenges with social distancing, access to grocery stores, water, and local and tribal health services. However, there are several steps individuals can take to keep your home and family safe. Wash hands often following these steps: Wet your hands with clean, running water (warm or cold), turn off the tap, and apply soap. Lather your hands by rubbing them together with the soap. Lather the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails. Scrub your hands, palms, back, between fingers and around fingernails for at least 20 seconds. Need a timer? Hum the \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d song from beginning to end twice. Rinse your hands well under clean, running water. If you do not have running water, make sure your water source is clean. Dry your hands using a clean towel or air dry them. If you can\u2019t wash with soap and water, you can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Place a dime-sized amount in your palm and rub hands together, covering all parts of the hand, fingers and nails until they feel dry Remind everyone in the household to avoid touching their face and cover their coughs and sneezes with the inside of their elbow or with a tissue, and then throw the tissue away. Regularly clean frequently touched surfaces (for example: tables, doorknobs, light switches, handles, desks, toilets, faucets, sinks, and electronics (see below for special electronics cleaning and disinfection instructions)) with household cleaners and EPA-registered disinfectantsexternal icon that are appropriate for the surface, following label instructions. Labels contain instructions for safe and effective use of the cleaning product including precautions you should take when applying the product, such as wearing gloves and making sure you have good ventilation during use of the product. It is important for people at higher risk for severe illness, hospitalization or death from COVID-19, to limit time spent away from the home. People at higher risk for severe illness include those who: are aged 65 years and older live in a nursing home or long-term care facility People of all ages with underlying medical conditions, including people with: chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma serious heart conditions conditions that can cause a person to be immunocompromised including cancer treatment, smoking, bone marrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies, poorly controlled HIV or AIDS, and prolonged use of corticosteroids and other immune weakening medications severe obesity diabetes chronic kidney disease and who are undergoing dialysis liver disease It isn\u2019t known if pregnant women are more likely to get sick from COVID-19, or if they are at higher risk to get severely ill. Pregnant women have had a higher risk of developing severe illness with other respiratory infections. It is always important for pregnant women to protect themselves from illness. Lack of access to grocery stores, water and health services may require more frequent trips to the store. If possible, send individuals that are not at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 to gather essentials for the home. Wear a cloth face covering in public settings, like grocery stores and pharmacies, where it may be more difficult to maintain social distancing. Tips for Multi-Generational Households It is important for people who are at higher risk for severe illness (individuals at risk are included in above section) to: Stay at home and away from crowds. Make sure you have access to several weeks of medications and supplies so you don\u2019t have to go out of the home. When you go out in public, keep at least 6 feet away from others. Do not go to places where people are sick. Wash your hands frequently, as described above. If someone in your home is sick with COVID-19 Have everyone continue to practice good handwashing methods as described above. Clean and disinfect surfaces, doorknobs and other commonly touched surfaces with common household disinfectants daily. Remind everyone to avoid touching their face, and cover coughs and sneezes with the inside of their elbow or with a tissue, and then throw the tissue away. As best as possible, isolate the individual with COVID-19 in a separate bedroom and bathroom away from others. Take care of the emotional health of your family, including yourself. Avoid sharing personal items like phones, dishes, bedding, or toys. If caring for a sick household member Monitor for emergency signs, like: Trouble breathing. Continual pain or pressure in the chest. New confusion. Bluish lips or face. Prevent the spread of germs: Avoid sharing personal household items, like dishes, towels, and bedding. Have the sick person wear a facemask (if available). If sick individuals are unable to wear a facemask, the individual caring for the sick should wear a facemask when in contact with them. Have them use a separate bathroom (if possible). Avoid having any unnecessary visitors. Treat symptoms: Make sure individual with COVID-19 drinks a lot of fluids to stay hydrated and rests at home. Use over-the-counter medicines to help with symptoms. For most people, symptoms last a few days and get better after a week.

Who is this for: Healthcare personnel who may care for patients who are confirmed with or under investigation for COVID-19. What is it for: This creates FAQs to support the existing Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Guidance for COVID-19. How is it used: To assist healthcare facilities in preventing transmission of COVID-19 in healthcare settings. Why does CDC continue to recommend respiratory protection equivalent or higher to the level provided by an N95 disposable filtering facepiece respirator for care of patients with known or suspected COVID-19? CDC\u2019s guidance to use NIOSH-approved N95 disposable filtering facepiece or higher level respirators when providing care for patients with suspected or known COVID-19 is based on the current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and related respiratory viruses. Current data suggest that close-range aerosol transmission by droplet and inhalation, and contact followed by self-delivery to the eyes, nose, or mouth are likely routes of transmission. Long-range aerosol transmission, such as is seen with measles, has not been a feature of SARS-CoV-2. Potential routes of close-range transmission include splashes and sprays of infectious material onto mucous membranes and inhalation of infectious virions exhaled by an infected person. The relative contribution of each of these is not known for SARS-Co-V-2. Facemasks commonly used during surgical procedures will provide barrier protection against droplet sprays contacting mucous membranes of the nose and mouth, but they are not designed to protect wearers from inhaling small particles. N95 and higher level respirators, such as other disposable filtering facepiece respirators, powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs), and elastomeric respirators, provide both barrier and respiratory protection because of their tight fit and filtration characteristics. Respirators should be used as part of a respiratory protection program that provides staff with medical evaluations, training, and fit testing. Although facemasks are routinely used for the care of patients with common viral respiratory infections, N95 or higher level respirators are routinely recommended for emerging pathogens like SARS CoV-2, which have the potential for transmission via small particles, the ability to cause severe infections, and no specific treatments or vaccines. CDC recommendations acknowledge the current challenges with limited supplies of N95s and other respirators. Facilities that do not have sufficient supplies of N95s and other respirators for all patient care should prioritize their use for activities and procedures that pose high risks of generating infectious aerosols and use facemasks for care that does not involve those activities or procedures. Detailed strategies for optimizing the supply of N95 respirators\u00a0are available on the CDC website. Once availability of supplies is reestablished, the guidance states that the use of N95 and higher level respirators should resume. What personal protective equipment (PPE) should be worn by individuals transporting patients who are confirmed with or under investigation for COVID-19 within a healthcare facility? For example, what PPE should be worn when transporting a patient to radiology for imaging that cannot be performed in the patient room? In general, transport and movement of the patient outside of their room should be limited to medically essential purposes. If being transported outside of the room, such as to radiology, healthcare personnel (HCP) in the receiving area should be notified in advance of transporting the patient. For transport, the patient should wear a facemask or cloth face covering to contain secretions and be covered with a clean sheet. If transport personnel must prepare the patient for transport (e.g., transfer them to the wheelchair or gurney), transport personnel should wear all recommended PPE (gloves, a gown, respiratory protection that is at least as protective as a fit tested NIOSH-certified disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirator or facemask\u2014if a respirator is not available\u2014and eye protection [i.e., goggles or disposable face shield that covers the front and sides of the face]). This recommendation is needed because these interactions typically involve close, often face-to-face, contact with the patient in an enclosed space (e.g., patient room). Once the patient has been transferred to the wheelchair or gurney (and prior to exiting the room), transporters should remove their gown, gloves, and eye protection and perform hand hygiene. If the patient is wearing a facemask or cloth face covering, no recommendation for PPE is made typically for HCP transporting patients with a respiratory infection from the patient\u2019s room to the destination. However, given current limitations in knowledge regarding COVID-19 and following the currently cautious approach for risk stratification and monitoring of healthcare personnel caring for patients with COVID-19, use of a facemask by the transporter is recommended for anything more than brief encounters with COVID-19 patients. Additional PPE should not be required unless there is an anticipated need to provide medical assistance during transport (e.g., helping the patient replace a dislodged facemask). After arrival at their destination, receiving personnel (e.g., in radiology) and the transporter (if assisting with transfer) should perform hand hygiene and wear all recommended PPE. If still wearing their original respirator or facemask, the transporter should take care to avoid self-contamination when donning the remainder of the recommended PPE. This cautious approach will be refined and updated as more information becomes available and as response needs change in the United States. Interim guidance for EMS personnel transporting patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 is available here. EMS personnel should wear all recommended PPE because they are providing direct medical care and in close contact with the patient for longer periods of time. What PPE should be worn by HCP providing care to asymptomatic patients with a history of exposure to COVID-19\u00a0who are being evaluated for a non-infectious complaint (e.g., hypertension or hyperglycemia)? Standard Precautions should be followed when caring for any patient, regardless of suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Patients with even mild symptoms1 that might be consistent with COVID-19 (e.g., cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, muscle aches) should be cared for by HCP wearing all recommended PPE for the patient encounter (gloves, a gown, respiratory protection that is at least as protective as a fit tested NIOSH-certified disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirator or facemask\u2014if a respirator is not available\u2014and eye protection [i.e., goggles or disposable face shield that covers the front and sides of the face]). Recent studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19. This underscores the importance of applying prevention practices to all patients including social distancing, hand hygiene, and surface decontamination. In addition, universal source control2 is recommended by everyone entering a healthcare facility. If the patient is without even mild COVID-19 symptoms then precautions specific to COVID-19 are not required but could be considered by regions experiencing high incidence of COVID-19 in the community. 1 Note: In addition to cough and shortness of breath, nonspecific symptoms such as sore throat, myalgia, fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea have been noted as initial symptoms in some cases of COVID-19. These symptoms can have several alternative explanations; however, failure to identify and implement proper precautions in a healthcare setting for persons infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 can contribute to widespread transmission in that facility due to the presence of susceptible patients and close interactions with healthcare personnel. For this reason, a lower temperature of 100.0oF and the inclusion of mild and non-specific symptoms should be used by healthcare personnel evaluating these patients to increase the ability to detect even mild cases of COVID-19. Additional information about clinical presentation of patients with COVID-19 is available. 2 Cloth face coverings are not considered PPE because their capability to protect HCP is unknown. Facemasks, if available, should be reserved for HCP. For visitors and patients, a cloth face covering may be appropriate. If a visitor or patient arrives to the healthcare facility without a cloth face cover, a facemask may be used for source control if supplies are available. What personal protective equipment (PPE) should be worn by environmental services (EVS) personnel who clean and disinfect rooms of hospitalized patients with COVID-19? In general, only essential personnel should enter the room of patients with COVID-19. Healthcare facilities should consider assigning daily cleaning and disinfection of high-touch surfaces to nursing personnel who will already be in the room providing care to the patient. If this responsibility is assigned to EVS personnel, they should wear all recommended PPE when in the room. PPE should be removed upon leaving the room, immediately followed by performance of hand hygiene. After discharge, terminal cleaning may be performed by EVS personnel. They should delay entry into the room until a sufficient time has elapsed for enough air changes to remove potentially infectious particles. We do not yet know how long SARS-CoV-2 remains infectious in the air. Regardless, EVS personnel should refrain from entering the vacated room until sufficient time has elapsed for enough air changes to remove potentially infectious particles (more information on clearance rates under differing ventilation conditions is available). After this time has elapsed, EVS personnel may enter the room and should wear a gown and gloves when performing terminal cleaning. A facemask (if not already wearing for source control) and eye protection should be added if splashes or sprays during cleaning and disinfection activities are anticipated or otherwise required based on the selected cleaning products. Shoe covers are not recommended at this time for personnel caring for patients with COVID-19. Why does CDC continue to recommend respiratory protection equivalent or higher to the level provided by an N95 disposable filtering facepiece respirator for care of patients with known or suspected COVID-19?

If the patient is without even mild COVID-19 symptoms then precautions specific to COVID-19\u00a0are not required but could be considered by regions experiencing high incidence of COVID-19 in the community. 1 Note: In addition to cough and shortness of breath, nonspecific symptoms such as sore throat, myalgia, fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea have been noted as initial symptoms in some cases of COVID-19. These symptoms can have several alternative explanations; however, failure to identify and implement proper precautions in a healthcare setting for persons infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 can contribute to widespread transmission in that facility due to the presence of susceptible patients and close interactions with healthcare personnel. For this reason, a lower temperature of 100.0oF and the inclusion of mild and non-specific symptoms should be used by healthcare personnel evaluating these patients to increase the ability to detect even mild cases of COVID-19. Additional information about clinical presentation of patients with COVID-19 is available. 2 Cloth face coverings are not considered PPE because their capability to protect HCP is unknown. Facemasks, if available, should be reserved for HCP. For visitors and patients, a cloth face covering may be appropriate. If a visitor or patient arrives to the healthcare facility without a cloth face cover, a facemask may be used for source control if supplies are available. What personal protective equipment (PPE) should be worn by environmental services (EVS) personnel who clean and disinfect rooms of hospitalized patients with COVID-19? In general, only essential personnel should enter the room of patients with COVID-19. Healthcare facilities should consider assigning daily cleaning and disinfection of high-touch surfaces to nursing personnel who will already be in the room providing care to the patient. If this responsibility is assigned to EVS personnel, they should wear all recommended PPE\u00a0when in the room. PPE should be removed upon leaving the room, immediately followed by performance of hand hygiene. After discharge, terminal cleaning may be performed by EVS personnel. They should delay entry into the room until a sufficient time has elapsed\u00a0for enough air changes to remove potentially infectious particles. We do not yet know how long SARS-CoV-2 remains infectious in the air. Regardless, EVS personnel should refrain from entering the vacated room until sufficient time has elapsed for enough air changes to remove potentially infectious particles (more information on clearance rates under differing ventilation conditions is available). After this time has elapsed, EVS personnel may enter the room and should wear a gown and gloves when performing terminal cleaning. A facemask (if not already wearing for source control) and eye protection should be added if splashes or sprays during cleaning and disinfection activities are anticipated or otherwise required based on the selected cleaning products. Shoe covers are not recommended at this time for personnel caring for patients with COVID-19. Which procedures are considered aerosol generating procedures in healthcare settings? Some procedures performed on patients are more likely to generate higher concentrations of infectious respiratory aerosols than coughing, sneezing, talking, or breathing. These aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) potentially put healthcare personnel and others at an increased risk for pathogen exposure and infection. Development of a comprehensive list of AGPs for healthcare settings has not been possible, due to limitations in available data on which procedures may generate potentially infectious aerosols and the challenges in determining if reported transmissions during AGPs are due to aerosols or other exposures. There is neither expert consensus, nor sufficient supporting data, to create a definitive and comprehensive list of AGPs for healthcare settings. Commonly performed medical procedures that are often considered AGPs, or that create uncontrolled respiratory secretions, include: open suctioning of airways sputum induction cardiopulmonary resuscitation endotracheal intubation and extubation non-invasive ventilation (e.g., BiPAP, CPAP) bronchoscopy manual ventilation Based on limited available data, it is uncertain whether aerosols generated from some procedures may be infectious, such as: nebulizer administration* high flow O2 delivery *Aerosols generated by nebulizers are derived from medication in the nebulizer. It is uncertain whether potential associations between performing this common procedure and increased risk of infection might be due to aerosols generated by the procedure or due to increased contact between those administering the nebulized medication and infected patients. References related to aerosol generating procedures: Tran K, Cimon K, Severn M, Pessoa-Silva CL, Conly J (2012) Aerosol Generating Procedures and Risk of Transmission of Acute Respiratory Infections to Healthcare Workers: A Systematic Review. PLoS ONE 7(4); https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3338532/#!po=72.2222external icon). Where should nasopharyngeal swabs be performed on a known or suspected COVID-19 patient, and with what PPE? The collection of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs from patients with known or suspected COVID-19 can be performed in a regular examination room with the door closed. Use of an airborne infection isolation room for nasopharyngeal specimen collection is not required. HCP in the room should wear an N95 or higher-level respirator (or facemask if a respirator is not available), eye protection, gloves, and a gown. If respirators are not readily available, they should be prioritized for other procedures at higher risk for producing infectious aerosols (e.g., intubation), instead of for collecting NP swabs. Do all patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 need to be placed in airborne infection isolation rooms? No. Updated\u00a0CDC\u00a0Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings\u00a0recommends placing patients in a regular examination room with the door closed. Airborne infection isolation rooms should be reserved for patients undergoing aerosol generating procedures or for diagnoses such as active tuberculosis. How long does an examination room need to remain vacant after being occupied by a patient with confirmed or suspected COVID-19? Although spread of SARS-CoV-2 is believed to be primarily via respiratory droplets, the contribution of small respirable particles to close proximity transmission is currently uncertain. Airborne transmission from person-to-person over long distances is unlikely. The amount of time that the air inside an examination room remains potentially infectious is not known and may depend on a number of factors including the size of the room, the number of air changes per hour, how long the patient was in the room, if the patient was coughing or sneezing, and if an aerosol-generating procedure was performed. Facilities will need to consider these factors when deciding when the vacated room can be entered by someone who is not wearing PPE. For a patient who was not coughing or sneezing, did not undergo an aerosol-generating procedure, and occupied the room for a short period of time (e.g., a few minutes), any risk to HCP and subsequent patients likely dissipates over a matter of minutes. However, for a patient who was coughing and remained in the room for a longer period of time or underwent an aerosol-generating procedure, the risk period is likely longer. For these higher risk scenarios, it is reasonable to apply a similar time period as that used for pathogens spread by the airborne route (e.g., measles, tuberculosis) and to restrict HCP and patients without PPE from entering the room until sufficient time has elapsed for enough air changes to remove potentially infectious particles. General guidance on clearance rates under differing ventilation conditions\u00a0is available. In addition to ensuring sufficient time for enough air changes to remove potentially infectious particles, HCP should clean and disinfect environmental surfaces and shared equipment before the room is used for another patient. My hospital is experiencing a shortage of isolation gowns. To preserve our supply, can we stop using gowns for the care of patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and other endemic multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), and Clostridioides difficile? CDC has released information about strategies to optimize the supply of isolation gowns. Healthcare facilities should refer to that guidance and implement the recommended strategies to optimize their current supply of gowns. This includes shifting toward the use of washable cloth gowns, if feasible. The use of gowns as part of Contact Precautions in the context of MDROs has been implemented primarily to reduce the risk of transmission to other patients rather than to protect healthcare personnel (HCP). Facilities with shortages could consider suspending the use of gowns for the care of patients with endemic MDROs, such as MRSA, VRE, and ESBL-producing Gram-negative bacilli except as required for Standard Precautions. Facilities should assess their local epidemiology to determine which MDROs are considered endemic. Regardless of the use of gowns, HCP at facilities should continue to wear gloves for contact with these patients and their environment. Hand hygiene should continue to be emphasized. Facilities should also attempt to place patients colonized or infected with an MDRO in a private room, if available. Caring for patients who have highly resistant Gram-negative organisms (e.g., carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriacae) and other MDROs (e.g., Candida auris) that are not considered endemic:\u00a0 Rather than gowns being donned for every room entry, they should be reserved for use as part of Standard Precautions\u00a0and also prioritized for high-contact patient care activities that pose highest risk for transfer of pathogens from the patient to HCP. Examples of such high-contact care activities include dressing, bathing/showering, transferring, providing hygiene, changing linens, changing briefs or assisting with toileting, device care or use (central line, urinary catheter, feeding tube, tracheostomy/ventilator), and wound care. To further preserve gowns, HCP are recommended to bundle high-contact care activities as part of individual care encounters. \u00a0Regardless of the use of gowns, HCP at facilities should continue to wear gloves for contact with these patients and their environment. Hand hygiene should continue to be emphasized. Facilities should also attempt to place patients colonized or infected with an MDRO in a private room, if available. Caring for patients with Clostridioides difficile infections (CDI):\u00a0 Facilities should continue using Contact Precautions (putting on a gown and gloves upon entry into the patient\u2019s room and placing the patient in a private room) for the care of symptomatic patients with CDI.\u00a0 As part of a supplemental strategy to prevent transmission of CDI, some facilities have implemented Contact Precautions for the care of patients at high risk for CDI who have asymptomatic carriage of Clostridioides difficile. There are limited data about the role of asymptomatic carriage in transmission of CDI. In this setting of a critical national shortage of gowns, facilities should consider suspending this approach until the shortage is addressed. Gowns should still be used as part of Standard Precautions."}

CDC will update this interim guidance as more information becomes available. Clinical Presentation Incubation period The incubation period for COVID-19 is thought to extend to 14 days, with a median time of 4-5 days from exposure to symptoms onset.1-3 One study reported that 97.5% of persons with COVID-19 who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of SARS-CoV-2 infection.3 Presentation The signs and symptoms of COVID-19 present at illness onset vary, but over the course of the disease, most persons with COVID-19 will experience the following1,4-9: Fever (83\u201399%) Cough (59\u201382%) Fatigue (44\u201370%) Anorexia (40\u201384%) Shortness of breath (31\u201340%) Sputum production (28\u201333%) Myalgias (11\u201335%) Atypical presentations have been described, and older adults and persons with medical comorbidities may have delayed presentation of fever and respiratory symptoms.10,11 In one study of 1,099 hospitalized patients, fever was present in only 44% at hospital admission but later developed in 89% during hospitalization.1 Headache, confusion, rhinorrhea, sore throat, hemoptysis, vomiting, and diarrhea have been reported but are less common (<10%).1,4-6 Some persons with COVID-19 have experienced gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and nausea prior to developing fever and lower respiratory tract signs and symptoms.9 Anosmia or ageusia preceeding the onset of respiratory symptoms has been anecdotally reported12, but more information is needed to understand its role in identifying COVID-19. Several studies have reported that the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 in children are similar to adults and are usually milder compared to adults.13-17 For more information on the clinical presentation and course among children, see Information for Pediatric Healthcare Providers. Asymptomatic and Pre-Symptomatic Infection Several studies have documented SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients who never develop symptoms (asymptomatic) and in patients not yet symptomatic (pre-symptomatic).14,16,18-28 Since asymptomatic persons are not routinely tested, the prevalence of asymptomatic infection and detection of pre-symptomatic infection is not well understood. One study found that as many as 13% of RT-PCR-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children were asymptomatic.14 Another study of skilled nursing facility residents infected with SARS-CoV-2 from a healthcare worker demonstrated that half were asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic at the time of contact tracing evaluation and testing.26 Patients may have abnormalities on chest imaging before the onset of symptoms.20,21 Some data suggest that pre-symptomatic infection tended to be detected in younger individuals and was less likely to be associated with viral pneumonia.20,21 Asymptomatic and Pre-Symptomatic Transmission Epidemiologic studies have documented SARS-CoV-2 transmission during the pre-symptomatic incubation period20,29-31, and asymptomatic transmission has been suggested in other reports.22,23,32 Virologic studies have also detected SARS-CoV-2 with RT-PCR low cycle thresholds, indicating larger quantities of viral RNA, and cultured viable virus among persons with asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.19,24,26,33 The exact degree of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA shedding that confers risk of transmission is not yet clear. Risk of transmission is thought to be greatest when patients are symptomatic since viral shedding is greatest at the time of symptom onset and declines over the course of several days to weeks.33-36 However, the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the population due to asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infection compared to symptomatic infection is unclear.37 Clinical Course Illness Severity The largest cohort of >44,000 persons with COVID-19 from China showed that illness severity can range from mild to critical38: Mild to moderate (mild symptoms up to mild pneumonia): 81% Severe (dyspnea, hypoxia, or >50% lung involvement on imaging): 14% Critical (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan system dysfunction): 5% In this study, all deaths occurred among patients with critical illness and the overall case fatality rate was 2.3%.38 The case fatality rate among patients with critical disease was 49%.38 Among children in China, illness severity was lower with 94% having asymptomatic, mild or moderate disease, 5% having severe disease, and <1% having critical disease.14 Among U.S. COVID-19 cases with known disposition, the proportion of persons who were hospitalized was 19%.39 The proportion of persons with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) was 6%.39 Clinical Progression Among patients who developed severe disease, the medium time to dyspnea ranged from 5 to 8 days, the median time to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) ranged from 8 to 12 days, and the median time to ICU admission ranged from 10 to 12 days.5,6,10,11 Clinicians should be aware of the potential for some patients to rapidly deteriorate one week after illness onset. Among all hospitalized patients, a range of 26% to 32% of patients were admitted to the ICU.6,8,11 Among all patients, a range of 3% to 17% developed ARDS compared to a range of 20% to 42% for hospitalized patients and 67% to 85% for patients admitted to the ICU.1,4-6,8,11 Mortality among patients admitted to the ICU ranges from 39% to 72% depending on the study.5,8,10,11 The median length of hospitalization among survivors was 10 to 13 days.1,6,8 Risk Factors for Severe Illness Age is a strong risk factor for severe illness, complications, and death.1,6,8,10,11,38-41 Among more than 44,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China, the case fatality rate was highest among older persons: \u226580 years: 14.8%, 70\u201379 years: 8.0%, 60\u201369 years: 3.6%, 50\u201359 years: 1.3%, 40\u201349 years: 0.4%, <40 years: 0.2%.38,42 Early U.S. epidemiologic data suggests that the case fatality was highest in persons aged \u226585 years (range 10%\u201327%), followed by 3%\u201311% for ages 65\u201384 years, 1%\u20133% for ages 55\u201364 years, and <1% for ages 0\u201354 years.39 Patients in China with no reported underlying medical conditions had an overall case fatality of 0.9%, but case fatality was higher for patients with comorbidities: 10.5% for those with cardiovascular disease, 7.3% for diabetes, and approximately 6% each for chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, and cancer.42 Heart disease, hypertension, prior stroke, diabetes, chronic lung disease, and chronic kidney disease have all been associated with increased illness severity and adverse outcomes.1,6,10,11,38,42,43 Accounting for differences in age and prevalence of underlying condition, mortality associated with COVID-19 in the United States was similar to China.39,40,44 Medications It has been hypothesized that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity.45 ACE inhibitors and ARBs increase the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 receptor to enter into the host cell. There are no data to suggest a link between ACE inhibitors or ARBs with worse COVID-19 outcomes. The American Heart Association (AHA), the Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA), and the American College of Cardiology (ACC) released a statement recommending continuation of these drugs for patients already receiving them for heart failure, hypertension, or ischemic heart disease.46 It has also been hypothesized that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may worsen COVID-19. Currently, there are no data suggesting an association between COVID-19 clinical outcomes and NSAID use. More information can be found at Healthcare Professionals: Frequently Asked Questions and Answers. Reinfection There are no data concerning the possibility of re-infection with SARS-CoV-2 after recovery from COVID-19. Viral RNA shedding declines with resolution of symptoms, and may continue for days to weeks.11,33,34 However, the detection of RNA during convalescence does not necessarily indicate the presence of viable infectious virus. Clinical recovery has been correlated with the detection of IgM and IgG antibodies which signal the development of immunity.36,47-49 Diagnostic Testing Diagnosis of COVID-19 requires detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA is better in nasopharynx samples compared to throat samples.33,50 Lower respiratory samples may have better yield than upper respiratory samples.33,50. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has also been detected in stool and blood.13,34,47,51 Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood may be a marker of severe illness.52 Viral RNA shedding may persist over longer periods among older persons and those who had severe illness requiring hospitalization. (median range of viral shedding among hospitalized patients 12\u201320 days).11,33-36 Infection with both SARS-CoV-2 and with other respiratory viruses has been reported, and detection of another respiratory pathogen does not rule out COVID-19.53 For more information about testing and specimen collection, handling and storage, visit Evaluating and Testing Persons for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Frequently Asked Questions on COVID-19 Testing at Laboratories. Laboratory and Radiographic Findings Laboratory Findings Lymphopenia is the most common lab finding in COVID-19 and is found in as many as 83% of hospitalized patients.1,5 Lymphopenia, neutrophilia, elevated serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, high CRP, and high ferritin levels may be associated with greater \u00a0illness severity.1,5,6,8,11,54 Elevated D-dimer and lymphopenia have been associated with mortality.8,11 Procalcitonin is typically normal on admission, but may increase among those admitted to the ICU.4-6 Patients with critical illness had high plasma levels of inflammatory makers, suggesting potential immune dysregulation.5,55 Radiographic Findings Chest radiographs of patients with COVID-19 typically demonstrate bilateral air-space consolidation, though patients may have unremarkable chest radiographs early in the disease.1,5,56 Chest CT images from patients with COVID-19 typically demonstrate bilateral, peripheral ground glass opacities.4,8,38,56-65 Because this chest CT imaging pattern is non-specific and overlaps with other infections, the diagnostic value of chest CT imaging for COVID-19 may be low and dependent upon interpretations from individual radiologists.57,66 One study found that 56% of patients who presented within 2 days of diagnosis had a normal CT58. Conversely, other studies have also identified chest CT abnormalities in patients prior to the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.56,67 Given the variability in chest imaging findings, chest radiograph or CT alone is not recommended for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The American College of Radiology also does not recommend CT for screening or as a first-line test for diagnosis of COVID-19. (See American College of Radiology Recommendationsexternal icon). Clinical Management and Treatment Mild to Moderate Disease Patients with a mild clinical presentation (absence of viral pneumonia and hypoxia) may not initially require hospitalization, and many patients will be able to manage their illness at home. The decision to monitor a patient in the inpatient or outpatient setting should be made on a case-by-case basis. This decision will depend on the clinical presentation, requirement for supportive care, potential risk factors for severe disease, and the ability of the patient to self-isolate at home. Patients with risk factors for severe illness (see People Who Are at Higher Risk for Severe Illness) should be monitored closely given the possible risk of progression to severe illness in the second week after symptom onset.5,6,10,11 For information regarding infection prevention and control recommendations, please see Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings. Severe Disease Some patients with COVID-19 will have severe disease requiring hospitalization for management. No specific treatment for COVID-19 is currently FDA approved. Corticosteroids have been widely used in hospitalized patients with severe illness in China6,8,10,11; however, the benefit of corticosteroid use cannot be determined based upon uncontrolled observational data. By contrast, patients with MERS-CoV or influenza who were given corticosteroids were more likely to have prolonged viral replication, receive mechanical ventilation, and have higher mortality.68-72 Therefore, corticosteroids should be avoided unless indicated for other reasons, such as management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or septic shock. More information can be found at Healthcare Professionals: Frequently Asked Questions and Answers. Inpatient management revolves around the supportive management of the most common complications of severe COVID-19: pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS, sepsis and septic shock, cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia, acute kidney injury, and complications from prolonged hospitalization including secondary bacterial infections, thromboembolism, gastrointestinal bleeding, and critical illness polyneuropathy/myopathy.1,4-6,10,11,38,73-76 The Infectious Diseases Society of America has released guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19. For more information, please visit: Infectious Diseases Society of America Guidelines on the Treatment and Management of Patients with COVID-19 Infection.external icon The World Health Organization and the Surviving Sepsis Campaign have both released comprehensive guidelines for the inpatient management of patients with COVID-19, including those who are critically ill.

Investigational Therapeutics No FDA-approved drugs have demonstrated safety and efficacy in randomized controlled trials for patients with COVID-19. Use of investigational therapies for treatment of COVID-19 should ideally be done in the context of enrollment in randomized controlled trials. Several clinical trials are underway testing multiple drugs with in-vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and/or immunomodulatory effects that may have clinical benefit.\u00a0 For the latest information, see Information for Clinicians on Therapeutic Options for COVID-19 Patients.

Discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions or Home Isolation Patients who have clinically recovered and are able to discharge from the hospital but who have not been cleared from their Transmission-Based Precautions may continue isolation at their place of residence until cleared. For recommendations on discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions or home isolation for patients who have recovered from COVID-19 illness, please see: Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions and Disposition of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19, Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19, and Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Immunocompromised Persons with COVID-19.

{"title": "Interim Guidance for Conserving and Extending Filtering Facepiece Respirator Supply in Non-Healthcare Sectors", "time": "2020-4-12 00:00:00", "author": "", "link": "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/conserving-respirator-supply.html", "content": "Audience: This guidance is intended for use during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) public health emergency by federal, state, and local public health officials, respiratory protection program managers, leaders in occupational health services and industrial hygiene programs, and other leaders who are responsible for developing and implementing policies and procedures for preventing occupational exposures in non-healthcare worksites. Purpose: This document offers strategies to conserve, extend, and respond to shortages in the supply of NIOSH-approved filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) used in non-healthcare worksites such as manufacturing and construction. NIOSH-approved FFRs protect users by filtering particles out of the air the user is breathing and include several classes of filters, including N95s. The following strategies apply the principles of the hierarchy of controls and are intended to assist employers in selecting strategies to control workplace exposures during times of known supply shortages caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Strategies 1 and 2 reinforce employer requirements for the continuous evaluation and implementation of traditional hazard control practices such as elimination, substitution, engineering and administration controls. Other strategies described herein include certain allowances such as use of FFRs beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life to be incorporated into practice only during times of supply shortages during the COVID-19 public health emergency. A secondary purpose is to reduce the demand for FFRs in general industry settings during the COVID-19 response so that (1) FFR manufacturers and distributors can maximize supplies to healthcare settings and (2) general industry worksites can evaluate if any excess inventories they may hold are suitable for redistributing (e.g., selling, donating) to healthcare settings. Employers should consider redistribution of excess inventories only if adequate exposure controls for their workers are implemented. For guidance to prevent workplace exposures to acute respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, please see CDC\u2019s Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers. Background The expanding outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States has created an overwhelming demand for personal protective equipment (PPE), including NIOSH-approved FFRs, in healthcare facilities across the country. Additionally, the supply chains of PPE from manufacturing countries have been substantially disrupted due to local COVID-19 spread and demand. Because of this increase in demand and decrease in supply, CDC has provided guidance to healthcare settings for strategies to optimize their supply of N95 respirators. This guidance describes surge capacity for healthcare facilities providing care in conventional, contingency, and crisis situations. The decisions to implement measures for healthcare facilities in contingency and crisis situations are based, in part, on the availability of N95 respirators, specifically, and other types of respirators, in general. In recognition of the demand for FFRs in the healthcare setting and the priority to protect healthcare workers who are the workers at highest risk for COVID-19, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued two emergency use authorizationsexternal icon to allow FFRs not typically worn in healthcare settings to be worn. This may reduce the availability of these FFRs for other worksites. Users of NIOSH-approved FFRs in non-healthcare settings should develop and implement strategies to conserve and extend their current stock of respirator supplies while protecting their workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Employers should implement alternative controls to reduce, as much as possible, their reliance on PPE, particularly FFRs. Conventionally, a hierarchy of controls has been used to provide feasible and effective controls to protect workers. Multiple control strategies can be implemented concurrently and/or sequentially. This hierarchy can be described as follows: Elimination Substitution Engineering controls Administrative controls Personal protective equipment (PPE) Elimination and Substitution Employers should evaluate work tasks and processes to identify those activities or processes where the elimination or substitution of hazards may be implemented. While the most effective at controlling hazards, these may be the most difficult to implement in existing processes, particularly during times of national or local emergencies. Engineering Controls Engineering controls reduce workers\u2019 exposures by placing a barrier between the hazard and the worker or removing the hazard at the source. While the initial cost of engineering controls can be higher than the cost of administrative controls or PPE, engineering controls generally provide a cost savings over the longer term and can eliminate the need for respirators if properly designed, implemented, and maintained. Examples for consideration includes: Local exhaust ventilation Wet methods (when water is sprayed on a dusty surface or when a material is mixed with water to prevent aerosolization) Glove boxes, cabinets, or other enclosures for isolation of the hazard Administrative Controls Administrative controls are used with existing processes to limit or prevent a hazard by changing the way people work. Examples include: Job rotation in which workers change job tasks or areas to reduce their exposures and the need to be in respiratory protection Establishing policies and implementing procedures limiting the amount of time that an individual worker can work on a specific job task or in areas with high exposures Training workers on the hazards and controls available to reduce exposures Installing warning labels and signs to remind workers to stay away from hazardous job tasks or areas Personal Protective Equipment While engineering and administrative controls should be considered first when implementing controls, PPE can be part of a suite of strategies used to protect workers. PPE includes respirators, protective gloves, protective eyewear and face shields, and a variety of other protective gear. PPE is frequently used with existing processes where hazards are not particularly well-controlled. This method for protecting workers is typically less effective than other measures due to the reliance on the user to put on, use, and take off the PPE correctly and the potential for PPE breaches. Additionally, proper use of respiratory protection requires a comprehensive program (including medical clearance, training, and fit testing) that complies with OSHA\u2019s Respiratory Protection Standardexternal icon. Recommendations In times of high demand and low supply of PPE due to the COVID-19 pandemic, non-healthcare sector employers should evaluate current work practices and control strategies to create a strategic exposure prevention and control plan to continue to protect workers. As part of such a plan, strategies for employers to consider are prioritized below. These measures are recommended to conserve and extend their FFR supply and to respond to shortages of manufacturer-supplied FFRs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has also provided guidanceexternal icon on many of these measures related to their enforcement of the Respiratory Protection Standard, 29 CFR 1910.134external icon, and certain other health standards, with regard to supply shortages of disposable N95 FFRs. The following measures emphasize engineering and administrative controls to implement for exposure prevention and control plans and to reduce reliance on FFRs Evaluate and execute long-term strategies for the elimination and substitution of hazards and the implementation of engineering controls for processes in which FFRs are currently required. NIOSH engineering control strategies are outlined for a variety of industries and hazards online at: https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/engcontrols/default.html Industry- and process-specific control strategies are detailed by the British Health and Safety Executive as a part of the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) Essentials and are available online at: https://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/guidance/index.htmexternal icon Implement immediately feasible engineering and administrative controls to eliminate or minimize exposures for which employers are currently requiring the use of FFRs. These controls should be routinely evaluated to ensure they continue to control exposures to acceptable levels and include: Moving work to inside ventilated enclosures such as fume hoods and biological safety cabinets. Modifying the processes to reduce exposures, such as putting dry materials into a wet slurry to reduce the potential for exposure. Postponing non-essential work requiring the use of FFRs. Limiting the number of workers needing respirators to the minimum required to safely complete the task. Arranging work/production schedules to reduce the number of respirators needed. The following measures may require changes in daily standard respiratory protection practices but may not have significant impact and may be used temporarily during periods of expected FFR shortages Use qualitative methods to fit test workers for FFRsexternal icon. Quantitative fit test methods require consuming FFRs during the fit test, while qualitative do not. As such, qualitative fit testing methods would conserve FFRs to be used for controlling workplace exposures. Transition respiratory protection programs to use NIOSH-approved alternatives to FFRs, where feasible. NIOSH maintains a searchable, online version of the certified equipment list identifying all NIOSH-approved respirators. Alternatives to FFRs, in order of preference to implement at non-healthcare worksites in order to preserve as many N95s as possible for healthcare settings, include: Elastomeric half facepiece air-purifying respirators: tight-fitting respirators that are made of synthetic or rubber material permitting them to be repeatedly disinfected, cleaned, and reused. They are equipped with exchangeable filter cartridges. Elastomeric full facepiece air-purifying respirators: Like the elastomeric half facepiece respirator, the elastomeric full facepiece respirator is a reusable device that uses exchangeable filter cartridges but has a clear plastic lens that covers the face and provides eye protection. Powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs): reusable respirators that typically have loose-fitting hoods or helmets. These respirators are battery-powered with a blower that pulls air through attached filters or cartridges. The filter is typically a high efficiency (HE) filter. Loose-fitting PAPRs do not require fit testing and can be worn by people with facial hair. When non-PPE controls cannot feasibly be implemented and when no alternative respirators to FFRs can be obtained, conserve current FFR supplies on-hand by extending the employer\u2019s schedule for when they are disposed and replaced. For companies with policies allowing the regular disposal and replacement of N95s and other FFRs, extended use of these FFRs beyond normal change-out schedules, when acceptable, can also be considered. The decision to implement policies that permit extended use of FFRs should be made by the professionals who manage the institution\u2019s respiratory protection program. Criteria for disposing and replacing FFRs include when breathing through the filter material becomes too restricted rather than simply disposing of them on a regularly scheduled basis such as after a single shift. In such cases, proper training on storage of used respirators is required. Use FFRs beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life for training and fit testing. In times of shortage, you may be able to use FFRs beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life for training and fit testing purposes. However, expired respirators might not perform to the requirements for which they were certified. Over time, components such as the strap and filter material may degrade, which can affect the quality of the fit and seal. Using such respirators for training and fit testing would allow non-expired N95 FFRs to be used for normal work operations. Use respirators approved under standards used in other countries that are similar to NIOSH-approved FFRs. (See Table 1.) Within Table 1, the country, conformity assessment standards, standards and guidance documents, acceptable product classification, and NIOSH classification are provided in alphabetical order. All of these respirators have protection factors of at least 10 in the countries listed in the table, as outlined in the standards and guidance documents specified. NIOSH has confidence that devices supplied by current NIOSH-approval holders producing respirators under the various standards authorized in other countries are expected to provide the protection indicated, given that a proper fit is achieved. Non-NIOSH-approved products developed by manufacturers who are not NIOSH approval holders, including those approved by and received from China, should only be used in crisis situations when no other NIOSH-approved N95 respirator or a listed device from one of the other recognized countries is available. To ensure this level of confidence, NIOSH has developed an assessment to evaluate the filter efficiency of respirators from other countries. NIOSH is happy to conduct the testing for you and provide you the results of the testing. The webpages to request respirator assessments are available here:\u00a0 https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/respirators/testing/default.html. The following measures may need to be considered during periods of known respirator shortages Use FFRs beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life for work operations. Consideration can be made to use FFRs beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life for work operations when no other controls or respiratory protection are available. Respirators beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life may not perform to the requirements for which they were certified. Over time, components such as the straps and nose bridge material may degrade, which can affect the quality of the fit and seal. Many models found in U.S. stockpiles have been found to continue to perform in accordance with NIOSH performance standards. Users should take the following precautionary measures prior to using the respirator in the workplace. Visually inspect the FFR to determine if its integrity has been compromised. Check that components such as the straps, nose bridge, and nose foam material did not degrade, which can affect the quality of the fit and seal and therefore the effectiveness of the respirator. If the integrity of any part of the respirator is compromised, discard the respirator and try another respirator. Users should perform a user seal check immediately after they don each respirator and should not use a respirator on which they cannot perform a successful user seal check. When the above control steps are not feasible, FFR and higher levels of respiratory protection are unavailable, and alternative respiratory protection strategies are not possible, it is recommended that work activities requiring such protection be suspended. Evaluating N95 FFR Inventories Held by General Industry for Transfer to Healthcare Settings Employers who successfully implement strategies for conserving and extending their FFR supplies during the COVID-19 pandemic may find that they possess excess inventories. It is recommended that employers consider redistributing (e.g., selling, donating) available excess inventories to healthcare settings during the COVID-19 pandemic to help reduce known shortages of respirators. Worksites that are no longer active due to emergency work stoppages and restrictions are encouraged to consider redistributing their excess PPE and fit test kits to their state medical countermeasure contacts, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)external icon, or through other appropriate channels. Non-healthcare employers who bought large quantities of respirators in the months preceding the crisis should consider if they are willing to redistribute (e.g., sell, donate) those respirators for healthcare use.

{"title": "COVID-19 and Cooling Centers", "time": "2020-4-11 00:00:00", "author": "", "link": "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/cooling-center.html", "content": "Who this guidance is for: Federal, state, local, and tribal jurisdictions in the United States considering opening or operating cooling centers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Purpose: This document provides interim guidance to reduce the risk of introducing and transmitting SARS COV-2 (the agent responsible for causing COVID-19 disease) in cooling centers. It should be used in conjunction with existing cooling center operation and management plans, procedures, guidance, resources, and systems. This interim guidance is based on what is currently known about the transmission and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Overview Extreme heat is a major public health concern in the United States. Exposure to extreme heat can cause a variety of health problems, including heat stroke and death. Cooling centers (a cool site or air-conditioned facility designed to provide relief and protection during extreme heat) are used by many communities to protect health during heat events. However, the use of cooling centers can result in congregating of groups of at-risk people, such as older adults or those with respiratory diseases, and potentially provide a route for the transmission of the SARS COV-2 virus and subsequent development of COVID-19 disease among both visitors and staff. Considerations and Potential Intervention Strategies Utility Assistance Consider implementing or expanding programs that provide utility assistance, such as the low-income home energy assistance program (LIHEAP) or similar methods that provide financial assistance for home air conditioner use. A temporary ban on utility shut-offs during heat waves would allow people to continue using home air conditioning. This strategy could lower the number of people utilizing cooling centers. Staff and Volunteers Plan for staff and volunteer absences. Develop flexible attendance and sick-leave policies. Staff (and volunteers) may need to stay home when they are sick, caring for a sick household member, or caring for their children during school dismissals. Identify critical job functions and positions, and plan for alternative coverage by cross-training cooling center staff. Screening and Alternative Sites for Symptomatic and Asymptomatic Individuals If resources are available, consider implementing verbal screening or temperature checks before admitting visitors to the cooling center. If possible, provide alternative cooling sites for those showing symptoms of COVID-19\u00a0(i.e., fever, cough, shortness of breath). This may be separate rooms within cooling centers or a space that can be used to accommodate visitors with symptoms and separate them from others. Designate an alternate site, or a separate room and bathroom (if available) for visitors with mild illness who remain at the cooling center. Be prepared to contact emergency officials (call 911) in the case of severe illness requiring medical assistance. Physical Distancing Maintain social (physical) distancing within cooling centers, ideally at least six feet between individuals. Consider separation of furniture and creating spaces for individual family units (families who live together do not need to maintain physical distancing in a cooling center). In larger cooling center facilities, it may be possible to provide adequate space for social distancing among visitors. Smaller cooling centers can limit the number of visitors, in accordance with local guidelines that limit the size of gatherings. This could lower capacity, so consider setting up a greater number of smaller cooling centers. If a lack of potential cooling center sites arises, emergency alternatives such as using parked air-conditioned buses can be utilized. Communities may also partner with closed businesses, such as movie theaters, as alternative cooling sites. Air Filtration It may not be possible to locate cooling centers in buildings with high ventilation capacity similar to healthcare facilities. If possible cooling centers should be equipped with air exchange systems, and be located in buildings with tall ceilings. Utilize the highest efficiency filters that are compatible with the cooling center\u2019s existing HVAC system, and adopt \u201cclean-to-dirty\u201d directional airflows. If resources allow, ceiling fans with upward airflow rotation combined with upper-air ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) disinfection systems can be utilized. When conditions allow (low humidity), shaded outdoor spaces with cross-draft airflow augmented by evaporative coolers may provide a safer alternative. Cleaning Follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) cleaning and disinfection guidelines for community facilities, and cleaning facilities if someone is sick. Because even individuals with no symptoms can still transmit the virus, and the virus can survive for several days on non-porous surfaces, it is important to continue routine cleaning and disinfection (every day if possible) with a focus on high touch surfaces, including those in common areas and bathrooms. Communication Enhance communication about COVID-19 onsite. Use health messages and materials developed by credible public health sources, such as your local and state public health departments or CDC. Read more about everyday preventive actions. Share or post COVID-19 posters and CDC Fact Sheets\u00a0and keep your visitors informed about public health recommendations to prevent disease spread. Messaging may include: Posting signs at entrances and in strategic places providing instruction on hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, cough etiquette, and cloth face coverings. Providing educational materials about COVID-19 for non-English speakers, as needed. Encouraging ill staff and volunteers to stay home (or be sent home if they develop symptoms while at the facility), to prevent transmitting the infection to others. Identify and address potential language, cultural, and disability barriers associated with communicating COVID-19 information to workers, volunteers, and those visiting cooling centers. Learn more about reaching people of diverse languages and cultures. Prevention Supplies If available, provide COVID-19 prevention supplies onsite at cooling centers. Have supplies on hand for staff, volunteers, and visitors, such as soap, alcohol-based hand sanitizers that contain at least 60% alcohol, tissues, and trash baskets. Visitors and staff should wear a cloth face covering, or if supplies are available, be given a clean disposable facemaskpdf icon, even if they are not showing any symptoms. Cloth face coverings should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance. Place posters\u00a0that encourage hand hygiene to help stop the spread at the entrance to the facility, at sinks in restrooms, and in other areas where they are likely to be seen.

{"title": "Interim Considerations for Infection Prevention and Control of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Inpatient Obstetric Healthcare Settings", "time": "2020-4-10 00:00:00", "author": "", "link": "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/inpatient-obstetric-healthcare-guidance.html", "content": "Summary of Recent ChangesRevisions were made on April 4, 2020, to reflect the following: Guidance has been updated to clarify the following: Considerations related to visitors and essential support persons to pregnant women who have known or suspected COVID-19 infection Prioritized testing of pregnant women with suspected COVID-19 at admission or who develop symptoms of COVID-19 during admission Isolation of infants with suspected COVID-19 from other healthy infants Determination of whether to keep a mother with known or suspected COVID-19 and her infant together or separated after birth on a case-by-case basis, using shared decision-making between the mother and the clinical team On This Page Prehospital ConsiderationsDuring HospitalizationMother/Baby ContactBreastfeeding These infection prevention and control considerations are for healthcare facilities providing obstetric care for pregnant patients with confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) or pregnant persons under investigation (PUI)\u00a0in inpatient obstetric healthcare settings including obstetrical triage, labor and delivery, recovery and inpatient postpartum settings. This information is intended to aid hospitals and clinicians in applying broader CDC interim guidance on infection control (Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings). Since maternity and newborn care units vary in physical configuration, each facility should consider their appropriate space and staffing needs to prevent transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19. These considerations include appropriate isolation of pregnant patients who have confirmed COVID-19 or are PUIs; basic and refresher training for all healthcare personnel on those units to include correct adherence to infection control practices and personal protective equipment (PPE) use and handling; sufficient and appropriate PPE supplies positioned at all points of care; and processes to protect newborns from risk of COVID-19. These considerations are based upon the limited evidence available to date about transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19, and knowledge of other viruses that cause severe respiratory illness including influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The approaches outlined below are intentionally cautious until additional data become available to refine recommendations for prevention of person-to-person transmission in inpatient obstetric care settings. Prehospital Considerations Pregnant patients with known or suspected COVID-19 should notify the obstetric unit prior to arrival so the facility can make appropriate infection control preparations such as identifying the most appropriate room for labor and delivery, ensuring infection prevention and control supplies and PPE are correctly positioned, and informing and training all healthcare personnel who will be involved in the patient\u2019s care of infection control expectations before the patient\u2019s arrival. If a pregnant patient who has confirmed COVID-19 or is a PUI is arriving via transport by emergency medical services, the driver should contact the receiving emergency department or healthcare facility and follow previously agreed-upon local or regional transport protocols. For more information refer to the Interim Guidance for Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Systems and 911 Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) for COVID-19 in the United States. Healthcare providers should\u00a0promptly notify infection control personnel at their facility of the anticipated arrival of a pregnant patient who has confirmed COVID-19 or is a PUI. During Hospitalization Healthcare facilities should ensure recommended infection control practices for hospitalized pregnant patients who have confirmed COVID-19 or are PUIs are consistent with Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings. All healthcare facilities that provide obstetric care must ensure that their personnel are correctly trained and capable of implementing recommended infection control interventions. Individual healthcare personnel should ensure they understand and can adhere to infection control requirements. Healthcare facilities providing inpatient obstetrical care should limit visitors to pregnant women who have known or suspected COVID-19 infections. Visitors should be limited to those essential for the pregnant woman\u2019s well-being and care (emotional support persons). Depending upon the extent of community-transmission, institutions may consider limiting visitors to one essential support person and having that person be the same individual throughout the hospitalization. Use of alternative mechanisms for patient and visitor interactions, such as video-call applications, can be encouraged for any additional support persons. Any visitors permitted to labor and delivery should be screened for symptoms of acute respiratory illness and should not be allowed entry if fever or respiratory symptoms are present. Visitors should be informed about use of masks (including cloth masks) for any person entering the healthcare facility and about appropriate use of personal protective equipment according to current facility visitor policy. Additionally, visitors should be instructed to only visit the patient room and should not go to other locations within the facility, including any newborn nursery. Pregnant women admitted with suspected COVID-19 or who develop symptoms concerning for suspected COVID-19 during admission should be prioritized for testing. Infants born to mothers with known COVID-19 at the time of delivery should be considered infants with suspected COVID-19. As such, infants with suspected COVID-19 should be isolated from other healthy infants, and cared for according to the Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed COVID-19. Mother/Baby Contact The many benefits of mother/infant skin-to-skin contact are well understood for mother-infant bonding, increased likelihood of breastfeeding, stabilization of glucose levels, and maintaining infant body temperature and though transmission of SARS-CoV-2 after birth via contact with infectious respiratory secretions is a concern, the risk of transmission and the clinical severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in infants are not clear. The determination of whether or not to separate a mother with known or suspected COVID-19 and her infant should be made on a case-by-case basis using shared decision-making between the mother and the clinical team. Considerations in this decision include: The clinical condition of the mother and of the infant SARS-CoV-2 testing results of mother (confirmed vs. suspected) and infant (a positive infant test would negate the need to separate) Desire to feed at the breast Facility capacity to accommodate separation or colocation The ability to maintain separation upon discharge Other risks and benefits of temporary separation of a mother with known or suspected COVID-19 and her infant If separation is not undertaken, other measures to reduce the risk of transmission from mother to infant could include the following, again, utilizing shared decision-making: Using engineering controls like physical barriers (e.g., a curtain between the mother and newborn) and keeping the newborn \u22656 feet away from the mother. Mothers who choose to feed at the breast should put on a face mask and practice hand hygiene before each feeding. If the mother is not breastfeeding and no other healthy adult is present in the room to care for the newborn, a mother with known or suspected COVID-19 should put on a face mask and practice hand hygiene1 before each feeding or other close contact with her newborn. The facemask should remain in place during contact with the newborn. These practices should continue while the mother is on Transmission-Based Precautions in a healthcare facility. If the decision is made to temporarily put the mother with known or suspected COVID-19 and her infant to reduce the risk of transmission in separate rooms, the following should be considered: Infants with suspected COVID-19 should be isolated from other healthy infants and cared for according to the Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings If another healthy family or staff member is present to provide care such as diapering, bathing and feeding for the newborn, they should use appropriate PPE. For healthy family members, appropriate PPE includes gown, gloves, face mask, and eye protection. For healthcare personnel, recommendations for appropriate PPE are outlined in the Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings Considerations to discontinue temporary separation in the healthcare setting are the same as those to discontinue transmission-based precautions, as described in the Discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions and Disposition of Patients with COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings (Interim Guidance). Patients who have clinically recovered and are able to be discharged from the hospital but who have not met criteria to discontinue temporary separation and who wish to reduce the risk of transmission to the newborn should continue separation at their place of residence until cleared as described in the Discontinuation of Home Isolation for Persons with COVID-19 (Interim Guidance). For more information regarding implementation of care at home, please see Interim Guidance for Implementing Home Care of People Not Requiring Hospitalization for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and Preventing the Spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Homes and Residential Communities Breastfeeding If temporary separation is undertaken, mothers who intend to breastfeed should be encouraged to express their breast milk to establish and maintain milk supply. If possible, a dedicated breast pump should be provided. Prior to expressing breast milk, mothers should practice hand hygiene.1\u00a0After each pumping session, all parts that come into contact with breast milk should be thoroughly washed and the entire pump should be appropriately disinfected per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. This expressed breast milk should be fed to the newborn by a healthy caregiver. If a mother with known or suspected COVID-19 and her infant do room-in and the mother wishes to feed at the breast, she should put on a face mask and practice hand hygiene before each feeding. Footnote: 1 Hand hygiene includes use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer\u00a0that contains 60% to 95% alcohol before and after all patient contact, contact with potentially infectious material, and before putting on and upon removal of PPE, including gloves. Hand hygiene can also be performed by washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If hands are visibly soiled, use soap and water before returning to alcohol-based hand sanitizer.

On This Page Administrators at Correctional and Detention FacilitiesStaff at Correctional and Detention Facilities People Who Are Incarcerated at Correctional and Detention FacilitiesFamily Members of People Who Are Incarcerated at Correctional and Detention Facilities Administrators at Correctional and Detention Facilities How to prepare your facility for the possible spread of COVID-19What steps should I take to prepare my facility?Because of close contact and the number of people in correctional and detention facilities (including prisons and jails), staff and people who are incarcerated are at greater risk for the spread of germs. To help your facility prepare for the possible spread of COVID-19, update your emergency operations plan. This includes: Adding key COVID-19 prevention strategies and posting information in the facility on how to limit the spread of germs. Reminding staff to stay home when sick. Identifying points of contact for local public health agencies. Identifying physical locations (dedicated housing areas and bathrooms) where you can medically isolate incarcerated persons, as well as where to quarantine known close contacts of people with COVID-19. Follow guidance on medical isolation and quarantine. Medical isolation and quarantine locations should be separate. Offering flu shots to staff and people who are incarcerated, because limiting cases of flu can help speed the identification of people with COVID-19. Developing ways to continue providing critical services, such as mental health support. Ensuring adequate stocks of hygiene, cleaning, and medical supplies. Hygiene: Soap (preferably liquid to promote use), tissues, and hand drying supplies, as well as hand sanitizers, when possible. Ensure no-cost access to soap. Cleaning: EPA-registered disinfectantsexternal icon effective against the virus that causes COVID-19 Medical supplies: Supplies for daily clinic needs, personal protective equipment (PPE), and testing Creating and testing communications plans to share critical information. Setting up systems to safely transfer people between facilities and identifying alternative strategies to in-person court appearances, when possible. Prevent confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases and their close contacts from being transferred between jurisdictions and facilities unless necessary for medical evaluation, medical isolation/quarantine, clinical care, extenuating security concerns, or to prevent overcrowding. Planning for staff absenteeism. Follow CDC guidance on recommended PPE for staff who will have direct contact with an individual with possible COVID-19 infection, or infectious materials. Make contingency plans for the likely event of PPE shortages. Follow the CDC Interim Clinical Guidance for Management of Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) and monitor the guidance website regularly for updates for staff evaluating and providing care for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases. When no on-site healthcare capacity is available, make a plan for how to ensure that people suspected to have COVID-19 will be medically isolated, evaluated, tested (if indicated), and provided medical care. Contact and collaborate with your state, local, tribal and territorial health departments for more specific guidance. How can I lower the chance that my staff will get COVID-19?The best way to protect your staff is to prevent exposure. Start by: Staying informed about updates to CDC guidance via the CDC COVID-19 website. Making sure staff are aware of COVID-19 symptoms and requiring staff with any flu-like symptoms to stay home (or be sent home if they develop symptoms while at the facility). Offering telework for staff when feasible, and exploring ways to revise duties that require face-to-face interaction for staff at high-risk for severe illness. Ensuring staff use everyday preventive actions\u00a0(such as washing hands, avoiding touching their eyes, nose, and mouth, covering their cough). Managing and monitoring staff absenteeism. Alert local public health officials about large increases in staff absenteeism, particularly if absences appear due to respiratory illnesses (like the common cold or the flu, which have symptoms similar to COVID-19). Offering flu shots to staff, as limiting cases of flu can speed up the identification of people with COVID-19. Stocking and providing supplies that help prevent the spread of germs. Routinely cleaning and disinfecting\u00a0the facility. Consult CDC guidance\u00a0on recommended PPE for persons in direct contact with COVID-19 cases. Review the\u00a0Occupational Safety and Health Administration websiteexternal iconexternal icon and guidance for businesses and employers\u00a0to identify any additional strategies the facility can use within its role as an employer. Staff evaluating and providing care for people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should follow the CDC Interim Clinical Guidance for Management of Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)\u00a0and monitor the guidance website regularly for updates to these recommendations. Facilities without on-site health care capacity should make a plan for how they will ensure that suspected COVID-19 cases will be medically isolated, evaluated, tested (if indicated), and provided medical care. Contact and collaborate with your state, local, tribal, and territorial health departments for more specific guidance. How can I lower the chance that people who are incarcerated will get COVID-19?The best way to prevent illness among people who are incarcerated is to prevent exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19. Start by: Staying informed about updates to CDC guidance via the CDC COVID-19 website. Making sure people who are incarcerated are aware of COVID-19 symptoms and remind them to notify staff right away if they might be sick. Posting information about and ensuring they use everyday preventive actions\u00a0(such as washing hands, avoiding touching their eyes, nose, and mouth, covering their cough). Stocking up and providing free access to soap (preferably liquid soap to promote use), tissues, and hand drying supplies, as well as hand sanitizer (where permitted based on security restrictions). Conducting temperature checks and screening all new entrants, staff, and visitors for flu-like symptoms during the last 24 hours, and any contact they may have had with someone infected with COVID-19 in the last 14 days. Offering flu shots to people who are incarcerated, as limiting cases of flu can help speed the identification of people with COVID-19. Routinely cleaning and disinfecting\u00a0surfaces and objects that are frequently touched. How to prevent the spread of COVID-19 within my facility or from the local community into my facilityHow can I find out if the virus has spread to the local community close to my facility?You can get up-to-date information about local COVID-19 activity by keeping in touch with your local and state public health officialsexternal iconexternal icon, and keeping up-to-date with the CDC website. What steps should I take to protect my staff and people who are incarcerated if there is spread of COVID-19 in the local community close to my facility?If COVID-19 is known to be spreading in the local community close to your facility, but there are no confirmed cases among people who are incarcerated, staff, or visitors who have been inside the facility within the past 14 days: Implement operational actions: Restrict non-essential transfers of people between facilities and systems. Use alternative strategies to limit in-person court appearances where possible. Consider suspending co-pays for incarcerated persons seeking medical evaluation for COVID-19 symptoms. Require staff to stay home if they are sick. Consider suspending visitation or offering non-contact visits only. Do not allow non-essential vendors, volunteers, or tours into the facility. Consider suspending work release programs. Clean and disinfect the facility: Use CDC recommendations for cleaning and disinfection during the COVID-19 response\u00a0to routinely clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that are frequently touched, especially in common areas. Use household cleaners and EPA-registered disinfectants effective against the virus that causes COVID-19external iconexternal icon Focus on good hygiene: Remind staff, visitors, and people who are incarcerated to use everyday preventive actions\u00a0(such as washing hands, avoiding touching their eyes, nose, and mouth, covering their cough). Provide free access to soap (preferably liquid soap) and access to running water, hand dryers, tissues, and no-touch trash cans, when possible. Continually restock hygiene supplies throughout the facility. Consider increasing the number of staff and/or other people who are trained to clean common areas to ensure they are cleaned on a continual basis. Conduct screenings for symptoms and fever on all new entrants, staff, and visitors prior to entering the facility and follow guidance. Use options to increase social distancing (increasing the physical space between people in the facility, ideally at least 6 feet between people, regardless of whether or not they have symptoms): Increase space between people who are incarcerated in holding cells and when in line. Stagger mealtimes and time in recreation spaces. Limit interactions in large group settings and group programs. When possible, place beds at least 6 feet apart and have people sleep head-to-foot. Find a separate space to check people for COVID-19 that is close to each housing unit instead of having people who are sick walk through the facility to be medically evaluated. Remind staff to keep 6 feet apart from an individual with respiratory symptoms when possible. Communicate regularly: Provide up-to-date information and remind and encourage people who are incarcerated and staff to report COVID-19 symptoms to staff right away. What should be included in my screening procedures for new entrants to the facility?New entrants should undergo temperature screening in addition to the following verbal screening questions: \u201cToday or in the past 24 hours, have you had any of the following symptoms? Fever, felt feverish, or had chills? Cough? Difficulty breathing?\u201d If yes, give them a clean, disposable facemaskpdf icon, separate them from others, and notify medical staff. Ensure only trained personnel wearing recommended PPE\u00a0have contact with individuals who have or may have COVID-19. Facilities without on-site healthcare staff should contact their state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health department to coordinate effective medical isolation and necessary medical care. \u201cIn the past 14 days, have you had contact with a person known to be infected with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19)?\u201d If yes (but no COVID-19 symptoms): Quarantine the individual and monitor for symptoms two times per day for 14 days. During quarantine, facility staff should follow guidance on quarantine, and monitor the person for symptoms two times per day for 14 days. Facilities without on-site health care staff should contact their state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health department to coordinate effective medical isolation and necessary medical care. What is a safe way to perform temperature checks?Staff performing temperature checks should follow these steps: Wash hands thoroughly. Put on a face mask, eye protection (goggles or disposable face shield that fully covers the front and sides of the face), gown/coveralls, and a single pair of disposable gloves. Check the person\u2019s temperature. If performing a temperature check on multiple individuals, ensure that a clean pair of gloves is used for each individual and that the thermometer has been thoroughly cleaned in between each check. If disposable or non-contact thermometers are used and the screener did not have physical contact with an individual, gloves do not need to be changed before the next check. If non-contact thermometers are used, they should be cleaned routinely as recommended by CDC for infection control. Remove and discard PPE. Wash hands thoroughly. Should I allow visitors into the facility if there is spread of COVID-19 in the community close to my facility?If there is spread of COVID-19 in the community close to your facility, consider suspending contact visits. If contact visits continue, all potential visitors should be asked: \u201cToday or in the past 24 hours, have you had any of the following symptoms? Fever, felt feverish, or had chills? Cough? Difficulty breathing?\u201d \u201cIn the past 14 days, have you had contact with a person known to be infected with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19)?\u201d Staff should also perform temperature checks for all visitors and volunteers. Any visitor who answers yes to one of these questions or who declines screening should not be allowed into the facility. When possible, facilities should let potential visitors know about these rules before they travel to the facility. Facilities can place posters in visiting areas and ask people who are incarcerated to inform their family members and visitors about these rules. How should the facility be cleaned to limit spread of the virus?To limit the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19, routinely clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that are touched often. Read CDC guidance on cleaning and disinfecting\u00a0to learn more. This may include cleaning objects and surfaces not ordinarily cleaned daily, such as doorknobs, light switches, and countertops. Clean with the cleaners typically used. Use all cleaning products according to the directions on the label. For disinfection, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants should be effective. A list of products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19 is available\u00a0herepdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon. How to manage a confirmed COVID-19 case in the facilityWhat should I do if a person who is incarcerated in my facility may have COVID-19?If you think someone who is incarcerated in the facility is sick with COVID-19 (see COVID-19 symptoms), activate your emergency plan and notify local public health officials. Ensure that the sick person is wearing a clean, disposable facemaskpdf icon, and separate the sick person from others, ideally within an individual housing space and bathroom. Provide them with tissues for when they cough or sneeze, and a lined trash receptacle when possible. Staff evaluating and providing care for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases should follow the CDC Interim Clinical Guidance for Management of Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) and monitor the guidance website regularly for updates to these recommendations. Facilities without on-site healthcare staff should contact their state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health department to coordinate effective isolation and necessary medical care. Ensure only trained personnel wearing recommended personal protective equipment (PPE)\u00a0have contact with or transport individuals who have or may have COVID-19. People who are incarcerated and have COVID-19 should be placed under medical isolation in a separate room, ideally with solid walls and a solid door that closes fully. If not available, refer to the full guidance document\u00a0for other options for medical isolation. If multiple people become ill with COVID-19: Make every effort to house each ill person individually, with their own bathroom. Refer to the full guidance document\u00a0for additional options if individual spaces are not available. Prioritize those at high risk for complications\u00a0of COVID-19 (older adults, people with severe underlying chronic medical conditions) for individual spaces that are available. To prevent further spread: Use options for virtual court appearances, if possible. Suspend group gatherings. Limit non-medical transfers of people within and between facilities. Ensure that anyone transferred out is screened for symptoms and contact with a COVID-19 case before leaving the facility. Ensure that release planning includes screening for COVID-19 symptoms and contact with a case. Coordinate with local public health officials if releasing a symptomatic person to the community. Use multiple social distancing strategies. Handle laundry and food items of possible or confirmed cases of COVID-19 with recommended PPE. Suspend visitation or offer non-contact visitation only. Consider quarantining all new entrants for 14 days before they enter the facility. (Make sure that new entrants under quarantine are housed separately from other incarcerated people already under quarantine due to contact with a COVID-19 case.) If releasing someone to a community facility (e.g., a homeless shelter), contact the facility\u2019s staff to ensure adequate time for them to prepare to continue medical isolation, and coordinate with local public health officials. Provide clear information to staff and people who are incarcerated about the presence of COVID-19 cases within the facility. Close contacts of the sick person (who have been within 6 feet of the sick person or had direct contact with infectious droplets, such as from a cough or squeeze) should be placed under quarantine for at least 14 days. Follow CDC guidance\u00a0on quarantining close contacts of people with COVID-19. If separate spaces for individual quarantined people are not available, refer to the full guidance document for other options. Monitor symptoms twice per day and move anyone developing symptoms to medical isolation right away (after ensuring they are wearing a face mask). Quarantined people at high risk for complications of COVID-19 (older adults, people with severe underlying chronic medical conditions) should not be housed with other quarantined people if at all possible. What should I do if one of my staff might have COVID-19?If you think someone on your staff is sick with COVID-19 (see COVID-19 symptoms), activate your emergency plan and notify public health officials. Give them a clean,\u00a0disposable facemaskpdf iconpdf icon and send them home right away. Close contacts of the sick person (who have been within 6 feet of the sick person or have had direct contact with infectious droplets, such as from a cough or squeeze) should self-quarantine at for 14 days home and follow CDC recommended steps for people who are sick with COVID-19 symptoms. What is the best way to clean and disinfect my facility after a confirmed case of COVID-19?Follow guidance for cleaning and disinfecting\u00a0rooms and areas where a person with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 have visited, including transport vehicles. Ensure staff or people who are incarcerated wear appropriate PPE when cleaning the facility and handling food service items of people with possible or confirmed COVID-19. Laundry of a person with COVID-19 may be washed with the laundry of other individuals. Individuals handling laundry should wear recommended PPE, should not shake the laundry, and should clean their hands often to prevent spread of COVID . Should I allow visitors into the facility?If there is a case of COVID-19 in your facility, suspend contact visitation programs. Instead, use virtual visitation when possible. What do medical staff need to know about caring for a person with COVID-19 in my facility?Facilities should ensure that incarcerated individuals receive medical evaluation and treatment at the first sign of COVID-19 symptoms. Staff evaluating and providing care for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases should follow the CDC Interim Clinical Guidance for Management of Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) and monitor the guidance website regularly for updates to these recommendations. Facilities without on-site healthcare staff should contact their state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health department to coordinate effective medical isolation and necessary medical care. Facilities should have a plan in place to safely transfer persons with complications from COVID-19 to a local hospital if they require care beyond what the facility is able to provide. When evaluating and treating persons with symptoms of COVID-19 who do not speak English, provide a translator when possible. Spanish and Simplified Chinese materials\u00a0are available for those who need them. What steps do I need to take to implement quarantine in my facility?Close contacts of a sick person (who have been within about 6 feet of the sick person or have had direct contact with infectious droplets, such as from a cough or squeeze) should be placed under quarantine for 14 days to determine if they develop symptoms. CDC has developed guidance\u00a0on quarantining close contacts of people with COVID-19. Be sure to monitor symptoms twice a day and move anyone developing symptoms to medical isolation right away, after ensuring that they are wearing a face mask. Individuals under quarantine should stay within the quarantine space, including when eating their meals, using the bathroom, and receiving medical evaluation. Laundry of people in quarantine can be washed with the laundry of others. Individuals handling laundry should wear recommended PPE, should not shake the laundry, and should clean their hands often. Ideally, people under quarantine due to contact with a COVID-19 case should be housed individually. If separate spaces in a facility are not available, refer to CDC\u2019s full guidance document for correctional and detention centers for other\u00a0options. People at high risk for complications of COVID-19\u00a0(older adults, people with severe underlying chronic medical conditions) should not be housed with other quarantined people if at all possible. Facilities without enough space or without onsite healthcare capacity should coordinate with local public health officials. Individuals in quarantine can be released from quarantine back to their previous housing arrangement in the facility if they have not developed symptoms during the 14-day time period. Staff at Correctional and Detention Facilities How can I lower the chance that I will get COVID-19?The best way to prevent illness is to take steps to avoid being exposed to this virus. Start by ensuring you and others around you use everyday preventive actions\u00a0(such as washing hands often, avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth, and covering your cough). Read How to Protect Yourself\u00a0to learn more. If there is spread of COVID-19 in the community close to the facility, you will be asked daily about symptoms over the last 24 hours and any contact you had with someone infected with COVID-19 in the last 14 days. Your temperature will also be checked daily. Do I have a greater chance of getting COVID-19?Staff and people incarcerated in correctional and detention facilities are at greater risk for some illnesses, such as COVID-19, because of the close living arrangements inside the facility. The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person, through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. This is why washing your hands regularly and avoid close contact with other people when possible prevents illness. What should I do if I think I may be sick with COVID-19?If you think you have been exposed to COVID-19 and develop a fever or symptoms of respiratory illness, such as cough or difficulty breathing, stay home. If you are at work, alert your supervisor right away and go home. Read What To Do if You Are Sick\u00a0to learn more. What does it mean to be in quarantine?Anyone who has close contact with a person with COVID-19 will need to stay away from other people for at least 14 days to see whether symptoms develop. If you are a close contact of a person with COVID-19, you should self-quarantine at home by staying in a separate room away from others.

The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person, through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or be launched into the air and inhaled into someone\u2019s lungs. It is possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or eyes; however, this is not the most likely way the virus spreads. What should I do if I think I may be sick with COVID-19?If you think you have been exposed to COVID-19\u00a0and develop a fever or symptoms of respiratory illness, such as cough or difficulty breathing, alert facility staff right away to make sure you receive medical care and protect the people around you from being exposed to the virus. What does it mean to be in quarantine?Anyone who has close contact with a person with COVID-19 will need to stay away from other people for at least 14 days to make sure they aren\u2019t sick as well. This means that they will be placed in a room separate from others, or just with other people who have also been exposed to the same sick person. During this time, they will be checked for COVID-19 symptoms. If testing is available, a person in quarantine may be tested several times until medical staff are sure they do not have the virus. Is it ok for people to visit me?Anyone who has had flu-like symptoms in the last 24 hours or has been in contact with someone who has or is suspected to have COVID-19 in last 14 days should not visit a correctional or detention facility. All visitors will be screened for symptoms and contact with someone with COVID-19. Staff will also perform temperature checks on all visitors. Visitors should contact the facility about their rules on visits before they travel. If a person in the facility has COVID-19, visitors may not be allowed to enter the facility. Instead, non-contact visits can be used, when possible. Family Members of People Who Are Incarcerated at Correctional and Detention Facilities Do people who are incarcerated have a greater chance of getting COVID-19?People in correctional and detention facilities are at greater risk for illnesses, such as COVID-19 because of their close living arrangements with other people. The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person, through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or be launched into the air and inhaled into someone\u2019s lungs. It is possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or eyes; however, this is not the most likely way the virus spreads. What does it mean if someone I know is in quarantine?Anyone who has close contact with a person with COVID-19 will need to put into quarantine for at least 14 days. This means that they will be placed in a room separate from others, until staff are sure that they don\u2019t have symptoms. During this time, they will be checked for COVID-19 symptoms twice a day. If testing is available, a person in quarantine may be tested several times until medical staff are sure they do not have the virus.

{"title": "Travel: Frequently Asked Questions and Answers", "time": "2020-4-10 00:00:00", "author": "", "link": "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/faqs.html", "content": "alert icon The COVID-19 pandemic is a rapidly evolving situation and CDC guidance is updated frequently. On This Page Canceling or Postponing TravelAir or Cruise Travel Returning from Travel Canceling or Postponing TravelShould I cancel my international trip?CDC recommends that travelers avoid all nonessential international travel because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0Some health care systems are overwhelmed and there may be limited access to adequate medical care in affected areas. Many countries are implementing travel restrictions and mandatory quarantines, closing borders, and prohibiting non-citizens from entry with little advance notice. Airlines have cancelled many international flights and in-country travel may be unpredictable. If you choose to travel internationally, your travel plans may be disrupted, and you may have to remain outside the United States for an indefinite length of time. CDC also recommends all travelers\u00a0defer all cruise ship travel worldwide. If you must travel, take the following steps to help reduce your chances of getting sick: Avoid contact with sick people. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. It is especially important to clean hands after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after coughing, sneezing or blowing your nose. Make sure you are up to date with your routine vaccinations, including measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and the seasonal flu vaccine. Air or Cruise TravelWhat is the risk of getting COVID-19 on an airplane?Because of how air circulates and is filtered on airplanes, most viruses and other germs do not spread easily. Although the risk of infection on an airplane is low, try to avoid contact with sick passengers, avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. For more information: Exposure Risk During Travel What happens if there is a sick passenger on an international or domestic flight?Under current federal regulations, pilots must report all illnesses and deaths to CDC before arriving to a US destination. According to CDC disease protocols, if a sick traveler is considered to be a public health risk, CDC works with local and state health departments and international public health agencies to contact passengers and crew\u00a0exposed to that sick traveler. Be sure to give the airline your current contact information when booking your ticket so you can be notified if you are exposed to a sick traveler on a flight. For more information: Contact Investigation Should I go on a cruise?CDC recommends that all travelers\u00a0defer all cruise ship travel worldwide. Recent reports of COVID-19 on cruise ships highlight the risk of infection to cruise ship passengers and crew. Like many other viruses, COVID-19 appears to spread more easily between people in close quarters aboard ships. Should travelers wear facemasks or coverings?In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, CDC recommends that everyone wear a cloth face covering over their nose and mouth when in the community setting, including during travel if they must travel. This as an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions. A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others. This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms. Medical masks and N-95 respirators are still reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance. Returning from TravelWhat can I expect when departing other countries?Some countries are conducting exit screening for all passengers leaving their country. Before being permitted to board a departing flight, you may have your temperature taken and be asked questions about your travel history and health. What can I expect when arriving to the United States?At this time, travel restrictions and\u00a0entry screening apply only to travelers arriving from some countries or regions with widespread ongoing transmission of COVID-19. [Note: US policies are subject to change as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves.] You may be screened when you arrive in the United States. After you arrive home, take the following steps to protect yourself and others: Stay at home and avoid contact with others. Do not go to work or school. Monitor your health. Take your temperature with a thermometer two times a day and monitor for fever. Also watch for cough or trouble breathing. Keep your distance\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad from others (about 6 feet or 2 meters) This is referred to as \u201csocial distancing.\u201d Check CDC\u2019s Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Travel webpage\u00a0to find the current travel health notice level for your international travel. When can I return to work after international travel?Currently, all international travelers arriving into the US should stay home for 14 days after their arrival. At home, they are expected to monitor their health and practice social distancing. To protect the health of others, these travelers should not to go to work or school for 14 days. What if I recently traveled and get sick?See CDC\u2019s website about what to do if you get sick.

A retirement community or independent living facility is a residential or housing community that is usually age-restricted (e.g., aged 55 and older) with residents who are partially or fully retired and can generally care for themselves without regular nursing or other routine medical assistance. \u00a0\u00a0Communal facilities, community activities, meals, transportation, and socialization opportunities may be provided. \u00a0Different types of independent housing with support services for older adults include: Public housing for low- to-moderate income elderly Assisted living homes that do not provide medical services Continuing Care Retirement Communities, which include a range of housing options including independent living. Who is this guidance for? This guidance is for owners, administrators, operators, workers, volunteers, visitors, and residents of retirement communities and ILF that are not healthcare facilities. Guidance for long-term care facilities (LTCF) that offer medical services, i.e., nursing homes, skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, and adult day care programs to older adults can be found here. Additionally, a checklistpdf icon\u00a0is available for use by long-term care facilities and assisted living facilities to assess and improve their preparedness for responding to COVID-19. Retirement communities and ILF can adapt this checklist to meet their needs and circumstances. Information relevant to retirement communities and ILF can also be found in guidance documents\u00a0 for older adults and people with serious chronic medical conditions and for community-based organizations. Why is this guidance being issued? COVID-19 is being increasingly reported in communities across the United States. It is likely that the novel coronavirus is circulating in most communities even if cases have not yet been reported. Residents in retirement communities and ILF are considered to be at higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes because of older age and because they may have underlying health conditions, such as chronic heart disease, diabetes, or lung disease. They also may be at higher risk of getting and spreading the virus because of community characteristics, such as frequent social activities, and shared dining facilities and communal spaces. Guidance specific to retirement and independent living communities can help the residents, and those who help serve them, slow the spread of the virus and prevent serious illness. This guidance takes into account that residents in retirement communities generally care for themselves. Retirement communities and ILF can also consider adopting the more stringent recommendations for long-term care facilities or nursing homes, especially if they are a continuing care retirement community that includes a long-term care facility.\u00a0 Either way, retirement community and ILF owners, administrators, or operators have an important role, working together with residents, workers, volunteers, and the local health departments in slowing the spread of diseases and helping ensure residents are safe."}

When using PPE optimization strategies, training on PPE use, including proper donning and doffing procedures, must be provided to HCP before they carry out patient care activities. All U.S. healthcare facilities should begin using PPE contingency strategies now. Maximize use of engineering controls, such as barriers and maintained ventilation systems, and administrative controls, such as altering work practices to minimize patient contacts. Cancel elective and non-urgent procedures/appointments. Reserve PPE for HCP and replace PPE normally used for source control with other barrier precautions such as tissues. Use re-usable PPE that can be reprocessed. Use PPE beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life for training. Consider allowing HCP to extend use of respirators, facemasks, and eye protection, beyond a single patient contact. U.S. healthcare facilities experiencing PPE shortages may need to consider crisis capacity strategies, which must be carefully planned before implementation. The effectiveness of crisis strategies is uncertain and they may pose a risk for transmission between HCP and patients. Consider using intact PPE that is beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life for patient care activities. Carefully prioritize PPE use for selected care activities. This could include reserving sterile gowns and gloves for urgent sterile patient procedures, such as surgery, and reserving respirators for aerosol-generating procedures and patient care with airborne transmitted disease risks, like tuberculosis, measles, and varicella. If no commercial PPE is available, carefully consider if alternative approaches will reduce the risk of HCP exposure and are safe for patient care. As PPE becomes available, healthcare facilities should promptly resume standard practices. Guidance"}

During this time, available respirators should be prioritized for procedures that are likely to generate respiratory aerosols, which would pose the highest exposure risk to HCP. When the supply chain is restored, organizations with a respiratory protection program should return to use of respirators for patients with known or suspected COVID-19. Organizations that do not currently have a respiratory protection program, but interact with patients infected with pathogens for which a respirator is recommended, should implement a respiratory protection program.

This document was updated to reflect the updates in the Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings. The changes include: Updated PPE recommendations Based on local and regional situational analysis of PPE supplies, facemasks are an acceptable alternative when the supply chain of respirators cannot meet the demand. During this time, available respirators should be prioritized for procedures that are likely to generate respiratory aerosols, which would pose the highest exposure risk to HCP. When the supply chain is restored, organizations with a respiratory protection program should return to use of respirators for patients with known or suspected COVID-19. Organizations that do not currently have a respiratory protection program, but interact with patients infected with pathogens for which a respirator is recommended, should implement a respiratory protection program. Updated language on collection of diagnostic respiratory specimens related to aerosol- vs. non-aerosol generating activities. Updated recommendations to include placing a facemask on symptomatic patients as source control. Related Pages CDC provides guidance on what specimens to collect when testing for COVID-19. The latest guidance is available online at Evaluating and Testing Persons for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). As part of the risk assessment and public health management of persons with potential COVID-19, public health personnel will typically conduct interviews and assess these individuals for fever or other symptoms of COVID-19. In certain circumstances they will also obtain respiratory specimens. This guidance is intended to address recommended infection prevention and control practices when these activities are performed at a home or non-home residential settings, which warrant additional considerations beyond those described for healthcare settings. For recommendations on the evaluation of PUIs in healthcare settings refer to the Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings. Interviewing and assessing persons with symptoms (PUIs for COVID-19): Make every effort to interview the PUI by telephone, text monitoring system, or video conference. Temperature monitoring could be reported by phone or shown to a provider via video conferencing If public health personnel must interview a PUI in their home, the public health personnel should wear recommended personal protective equipment (PPE), including a gown, gloves, eye protection such as goggles or a disposable face shield that covers the front and sides of the face, and respiratory protection such as a NIOSH-approved N-95 or higher-level respirator or facemask (if a respirator is not available), as recommended the Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings. Hand hygiene should be performed before putting on PPE using alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95% alcohol. PPE should ideally be put on outside of the home prior to entry into the home. If unable to put on all PPE outside of the home, it is still preferred that face protection such as a respirator or facemask and eye protection be put on before entering the home. Ask the PUI or a household member if an external trash can is present at the home, or if one can be left outside for the disposal of PPE. Alert persons within the home that the public health personnel will be entering the home and ask them to move to a different room, if possible, or keep a 6-foot distance in the same room. Once the entry area is clear, enter the home and put on a gown and gloves. Ask symptomatic PUIs to wear a facemask during the visit if able to tolerate and one is available. PPE should ideally be removed outside of the home and discarded by placing in a plastic bag and into an external trash can before departing location. PPE should not be taken from the PUI\u2019s home in public health personnel\u2019s vehicle. Public health officials should carry a supply of plastic bags for disposal of PPE. If unable to remove all PPE outside of the home, it is still preferred that face protection such as respirator or facemask and eye protection be removed after exiting the home. If gown and gloves must be removed in the home, ask persons within the home to move to a different room, if possible, or keep a 6-foot distance in the same room. Once the entry area is clear, remove gown and gloves and exit the home. If hands get contaminated during glove or gown removal, once outside the home, perform hand hygiene with alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95% alcohol. Then remove face protection and discard PPE by placing in external trash can before departing location. Perform hand hygiene again. Interviewing and assessing persons without symptoms (asymptomatic close contacts who have been exposed to a suspect or lab-confirmed case of COVID-19): Make every effort to interview the asymptomatic close contact by telephone, text monitoring system, or video conference. Temperature monitoring could be reported by phone or shown to a provider via video conferencing. If public health personnel must interview the asymptomatic close contact in person, the public health personnel should stay at least 6 feet away from the asymptomatic close contact and ask them if they have had fevers or respiratory symptoms. The public health personnel should put on a face mask when entering the home. Ask asymptomatic close contacts wear a facemask during the visit if one is available. If the interview and assessment is occurring in the home environment, the public health personnel should not enter the home until these questions have been asked and the asymptomatic close contact has been determined to be afebrile by temperature measurement. If the asymptomatic close contact reports fever or symptoms, they should be considered a PUI and referred for further medical evaluation as appropriate. Public health personnel should document temperature measurement and description of symptoms. If the asymptomatic close contact does not report fever or symptoms, they should be instructed to take their own temperature and report the result. If the asymptomatic close contact reports having no symptoms and fever is not detected, it remains appropriate to stay at least 6 feet away during further interactions even if entering the home environment. If they are not able to take their own temperature, the public health personnel should: Perform hand hygiene using alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95% alcohol Put on a facemask, eye protection and gloves Proceed with checking the asymptomatic close contact\u2019s temperature PPE should ideally be removed outside of the home and discarded by placing in a plastic bag and into an external trash can before departing location. PPE should not be taken from the PUI\u2019s home in public health personnel\u2019s vehicle. Public health officials should carry a supply of plastic bags for disposal of PPE. If unable to remove all PPE outside of the home, it is still preferred that face protection such as respirator or facemask and eye protection be removed after exiting the home. If gloves must be removed in the home, ask persons within the home to move to a different room, if possible, or keep a 6-foot distance in the same room. Once the entry area is clear, remove gloves and exit the home. If hands get contaminated during glove removal, once outside the home, perform hand hygiene with alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95% alcohol. Then remove face protection and discard PPE by placing in external trash can before departing location. Perform hand hygiene again Diagnostic respiratory specimen (nasopharyngeal swab) collection for all PUIs for COVID-19 at home: Alert persons within the home that public health personnel will be collecting a diagnostic respiratory specimen. Ask person being tested if an external trash can is present at the home, or if one can be left outside for the disposal of PPE. Identify a location for swab collection: Testing for the virus that causes COVID-19 should be conducted outdoors if climate allows. If performing this outdoors, identify a location that provides privacy to the individual being tested. If conducted in the home, specimen collection should be performed in the area of the house where the individual being tested self-isolates. Only the public health personnel and individual being tested should be in the room/area when testing is performed. Follow guidance in CDC\u2019s Interim Guidelines for Collecting, Handling, and Testing Clinical Specimens from Persons for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Collecting diagnostic respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal swab) is likely to induce cough or sneezing. Specimen collection should be the last activity performed just before leaving the home or outdoor collection area. Allow for self-or healthcare worker-collected nasal turbinate swab if nasal pharyngeal swab is not possible. Public health personnel collecting specimens should wear recommended PPE, including a gown, gloves, eye protection, and respiratory protection such as a NIOSH-approved N-95 or higher-level respirator or facemask (if a respirator is not available), as recommended in the Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings. Hand hygiene should be performed before putting on PPE using alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95% alcohol. PPE should ideally be put on outside of the home prior to entry into the home. If unable to put on all PPE outside of the home, it is still preferred that face protection (respirator or facemask and eye protection) be donned before entering the home. Once the entry area is clear, enter the home and put on a gown and gloves. PPE should ideally be removed outside of the home and discarded by placing in external trash can before departing location. PPE should not be taken from the home of the person being tested in public health personnel\u2019s vehicle. If unable to remove all PPE outside of the home, it is still preferred that face protection (respirator or facemask and eye protection) be removed after exiting the home. If gown and gloves must be removed in the home, ask persons within the home to move to a different room, if possible, or keep a 6-foot distance in the same room. Once the entry area is clear, remove gown and gloves and exit the home. Once outside the home, perform hand hygiene with alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95% alcohol, remove face protection and discard PPE by placing in external trash can before departing location. Perform hand hygiene again. The testing of asymptomatic persons may occur in special situations. The above infection control recommendations apply for collection of specimens from asymptomatic persons as well."}

Symptoms often include a fever, cough or shortness of breath. Our understanding of how the virus is spreading is evolving as we learn more about it, so check the CDC website for the latest information. The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person: Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. Recent studies indicate that the virus can be spread by people before they develop symptoms (pre-symptomatic) or who never develop symptoms (asymptomatic). It also may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. However, this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. Older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions may be at higher risk for more serious complications from COVID-19."}
{"title": "CDC Announces Modifications and Extension of No Sail Order for All Cruise Ships", "time": "2020-4-9 00:00:00", "author": "", "link": "https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/s0409-modifications-extension-no-sail-ships.html", "content": "Media StatementFor Immediate Release: Thursday, April 9, 2020 Contact:\u00a0Media Relations (404) 639-3286 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced today the extension of a No Sail Order for all cruise ships. \u201cWe are working with the cruise line industry to address the health and safety of crew at sea as well as communities surrounding U.S. cruise ship points of entry,\u201d said CDC Director Robert Redfield.\u00a0 \u201cThe measures we are taking today to stop the spread of COVID-19 are necessary to protect Americans, and we will continue to provide critical public health guidance to the industry to limit the impacts of COVID-19 on its workforce throughout the remainder of this pandemic.\u201d The No Sail Order reinforces the strong action by President Donald J. Trump and the White House Coronavirus Task Force to combat the spread of COVID-19 in the United States. President Trump acted early and decisively to implement travel restrictions on foreign nationals who had recently been to China and Europe and by issuing the 30 Days to Slow the Spread guidelines. These containment and mitigation strategies have been a critical component of the United States COVID-19 response, but despite these efforts, cruise ship travel markedly increases the risk and impact of the COVID-19 outbreak within the United States. In recent weeks, at least 10 cruise ships reported crew or passengers that tested positive or experienced respiratory symptoms or influenza-like illness. Currently, there are approximately 100 cruise ships remaining at sea off the East Coast, West Coast, and Gulf Coast, with nearly 80,000 crew onboard. Additionally, CDC is aware of 20 cruise ships at port or anchorage in the United States with known or suspected COVID-19 infection among the crew who remain onboard. There are several public health concerns when crew members become ill while onboard the cruise ships.\u00a0 As we have seen with the passenger illness response on cruise ships, safely evacuating, triaging, and repatriating cruise ship crew has involved complex logistics, incurs financial costs at all levels of government, and diverts resources away from larger efforts to suppress or mitigate COVID-19. The addition of further COVID-19 cases from cruise ships also places healthcare workers at substantial increased risk. Some of these ships off the coast of the United States have crew that are not critical to maintain the seaworthiness or basic safe operation of the cruise ships, such as the vessel\u2019s hotel and hospitality staff. The U.S. Government remains committed to humanitarian medevac for individuals in dire need of life-saving support. The CDC, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the Department of Homeland Security have been working with the industry to determine the most appropriate public health strategy to limit the impact of COVID-19 at cruise ship ports of entry in the United States.\u00a0 Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) voluntarily suspended cruise ship operations in March in conjunction with the earlier No Sail Order issued March 14.\u00a0 The industry has since been working to build an illness response framework to combat COVID-19 on ships with international crew members who remain on board and at sea. This order ceases operations of cruise ships in waters in which the United States may exert jurisdiction and requires that they develop a comprehensive, detailed operational plan approved by CDC and the USCG to address the COVID-19 pandemic through maritime focused solutions, including a fully implementable response plan with limited reliance on state, local, and federal government support.\u00a0 These plans would help prevent, mitigate, and respond to the spread of COVID-19, by: monitoring of passengers and crew medical screenings; training crew on COVID-19 prevention; managing and responding to an outbreak on board; and submitting a plan to USCG and CDC for review This Order shall continue in operation until the earliest of three situations. First, the expiration of the Secretary of Health and Human Services\u2019 declaration that COVID-19 constitutes a public health emergency.\u00a0 Second, the CDC Director rescinds or modifies the order based on specific public health or other considerations.\u00a0 Or third, 100 days from the date of publication in the Federal Register. Additional information in the order includes: Cruise ship operators are not allowed to disembark travelers (passengers or crew) at ports or stations, except as directed by the USCG, in consultation with HHS/CDC personnel, and as appropriate, as coordinated with federal, state, and local authorities. Cruise ship operators should not embark or re-embark any crew member, except as approved by the USCG, in consultation with HHS/CDC personnel, until further notice. While in port, cruise ship operators shall observe health precautions directed by HHS/CDC personnel. The cruise ship operator should comply with all HHS/CDC, USCG, and other federal agency instructions to follow CDC recommendations and guidance for any public health actions relating to passengers, crew, ship, or any article or thing onboard the ship, as needed, including by making ship\u2019s manifests and logs available and collecting any specimens for COVID-19 testing.

{"title": "CDC\u2019s role in helping cruise ship travelers during the COVID-19 pandemic", "time": "2020-4-9 00:00:00", "author": "", "link": "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/cruise-ship/what-cdc-is-doing.html", "content": "As of April 4, 2020, CDC has updated its recommendations to help US cruise ship travelers (passengers and crew) get home as quickly and safely as possible during the COVID-19 pandemic. CDC is working with partners as part of the Unified Command, including Coast Guard, Customs and Border Protection, port authorities, local and state health departments, and Department of State, to respond to COVID-19 aboard cruise ships. CDC recommends that cruise ship travelers with no symptoms or mild symptoms disembark as quickly and safely as possible at US ports of entry: Cruise line companies must get travelers directly to their homes via chartered or private transportation. Commercial flights and public transportation may not be used. Since February 2020, travelers on dozens of cruise ships have been affected by COVID-19 outbreaks. Cruise ships are often settings for outbreaks of infectious diseases because of the semi-enclosed environment and contact between travelers from many countries. Outbreaks of COVID-19 on cruise ships pose a risk for rapid spread of disease beyond the voyage. Aggressive efforts are required to contain spread. CDC realizes that it might be confusing for travelers when recommendations change during the COVID-19 pandemic response. The COVID-19 pandemic in the United States and globally is constantly changing. We will continue to evaluate and update our recommendations for returning cruise ship travelers as the situation evolves. For Returning Cruise Ship Travelers For Returning Cruise Ship Travelers Well Travelers Before leaving your cabin to begin ship disembarkation, put on a face mask or cloth face covering\u00a0issued to you by the cruise line. Keep the face covering on from the time you leave your cabin, during disembarkation and during all air and land travel. To the extent possible, do not remove the face covering until you get to your final destination. You should only travel with other well travelers by chartered or private transportation. Do not board a commercial flight or other public transportation. While traveling, you should spread out if space allows (6 feet apart from non-travel companions, if possible). Sit next to your cruise ship travel companion(s) if you\u2019re traveling with someone. If you develop symptoms during travel, notify the medical staff of your symptoms and continue to wear your cloth face covering. If you are on a chartered flight without medical staff, tell the CDC Quarantine Station staff as soon as you disembark the plane. When you arrive at your final destination, you should stay home for 14 days and monitor your health. Travelers who are Ill Before leaving your cabin, put on a face mask issued to you by the cruise line. Keep the mask on from the time you leave your cabin, during disembarkation and during all air and land travel. To the extent possible, do not remove the mask until you get to your final destination. If you have symptoms of COVID-19\u00a0or have confirmed COVID-19, do not travel with well travelers who have no symptoms. Cabin mates with no symptoms may accompany you if they provide written consent to the cruise line ahead of time. If you are well enough to travel, you should only travel to your home by charter flight, air ambulance, or ground ambulance, or another private vehicle that can be properly sanitized. Your cruise line is responsible for your medical care. If you require emergency medical attention, your cruise line will coordinate with public health and U.S. Coast Guard and, if necessary, arrange for appropriate transportation to a place where you can get attention. For Cruise Ship Companies Cruise lines are responsible for treating all ill or infected patients, including those who need hospitalization. For travelers who need emergency medical attention, cruise lines should coordinate with public health and U.S. Coast Guard to arrange for appropriate transportation to a place where such care can occur. Cruise lines must arrange for disembarking travelers with no symptoms or mild symptoms to return directly to their residence by chartered or private transportation that can be properly sanitized. Commercial flights and other public transportation may not be used. Travelers with mild symptoms may return home alone or with other symptomatic travelers by charter flight, air ambulance, ground ambulance or other private vehicle that can be properly sanitized. Cabin mates with no symptoms may accompany ill travelers if they provide written consent to the cruise line ahead of time. Well travelers with no symptoms may return home alone or with other well travelers by charter flight or other private vehicle that can be properly sanitized. Cruise ship companies should provide to all travelers, including crew, a procedural/surgical mask, cloth face covering, or non-medical mask such as a bandanna, and ask them to wear it during: ship disembarkation, transport to any flights, the duration of the flight(s), and any ground transportation until they reach their final destination. Cruise ship companies should NOT be distributing N-95 respirator masks to passengers or crew. Before attempting to repatriate travelers by international charter flight to the United States Before chartering flights back to the United States, cruise lines should: Screen all US-bound passengers or crew who will board the US charter\u00a0flight for fever (100.4\u00b0 F or 38\u00b0 C or higher) or feeling feverish or new or worsening cough, or shortness of breath. Symptomatic passengers should not board a charter flight with well passengers. Notify\u00a0CDC about any passengers with COVID-19 symptoms, including confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases. Obtain full approval from state and local authorities before planning for the arrival of passengers in the state\u00a0where the charter flight is bound. Distribute general CDC COVID-19 health informationpdf icon\u00a0to cruise ship passengers eligible to board a US-bound flight.\u00a0Advise passengers to stay home, monitor their health, and practice social distancing for 14 days after they arrive in the United States. Ensure the air carrier has stocked sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) for the flight crew. For public health officials The Department of State, with approval from the Department of Homeland Security, decides whether to allow chartered international flights to return with cruise ship passengers to the United States. It is required that flights report to CDC any illnesses and deaths on domestic flights between US states and territories and on international flights arriving in the United States. If illnesses or deaths were reported on the flight, local airport responders will coordinate with the CDC Quarantine Station of jurisdiction to ensure safe assessment of the affected traveler. CDC may notify some states through Epi-X about sick passengers on flights under some circumstances. Cruise Ships Affected by COVID-19 These are cruise ships that had voyages with US ports, which are under US CDC jurisdiction. International voyages without US ports of call are not under CDC jurisdiction and not included.

For all other ships, CDC was notified about travelers who had symptoms and tested positive for COVID-19 within 14 days after disembarking. Since these travelers\u2019 symptoms began after the voyage, the traveler might have contracted COVID-19 during the voyage; however, other sources of transmission after the voyage cannot be ruled out.

COVID-19 is a respiratory illness that can spread from person to person. The outbreak first started in China, but the virus continues to spread internationally and in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will update this interim guidance as additional information becomes available. The following interim guidance may help prevent workplace exposures to COVID-19, in non-healthcare settings. (CDC has provided separate guidance for healthcare settings.) This guidance also provides planning considerations for community spread of COVID-19. To prevent stigma and discrimination in the workplace, use only the guidance described below to determine risk of COVID-19 infection. Do not make determinations of risk based on race or country of origin and be sure to maintain confidentiality of people with confirmed coronavirus infection. There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features of COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing. Updates are available on CDC\u2019s web page. Preparing Workplaces for a COVID-19 Outbreak Businesses and employers can prevent and slow the spread of COVID-19. Employers should plan to respond in a flexible way to varying levels of disease transmission in the community and be prepared to refine their business response plans as needed. According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), most American workers will likely experience low (caution) or medium exposure risk levels at their job or place of employment (see OSHA guidance for employerspdf iconexternal icon for more information about job risk classifications). Businesses are strongly encouraged to coordinate with stateexternal icon and localexternal icon health officials so timely and accurate information can guide appropriate responses. Local conditions will influence the decisions that public health officials make regarding community-level strategies. CDC has guidance for mitigation strategiespdf icon\u00a0according to the level of community transmission or impact of COVID-19. All employers need to consider how best to decrease the spread of COVID-19 and lower the impact in their workplace. This may include activities in one or more of the following areas: reduce transmission among employees, maintain healthy business operations, and maintain a healthy work environment. Reduce Transmission Among Employees Actively encourage sick employees to stay home: Employees who have symptoms\u00a0(i.e., fever, cough, or shortness of breath) should notify their supervisor and stay home. Sick employees should follow CDC-recommended steps. Employees should not return to work until the criteria to discontinue home isolation are met, in consultation with healthcare providers and state and local health departments. Employees who are well but who have a sick family member at home with COVID-19 should notify their supervisor and follow CDC recommended precautions. Identify where and how workers might be exposed to COVID-19 at work: See OSHA COVID-19external icon webpage for more information on how to protect workers from potential exposures and guidance for employerspdf iconexternal icon, including steps to take for jobs according to exposure risk. Be aware that some employees may be at higher risk for serious illness, such as older adults\u00a0and those with chronic medical conditions. Consider minimizing face-to-face contact between these employees or assign work tasks that allow them to maintain\u00a0a distance of six feet from\u00a0other workers, customers and visitors, or to telework if possible. Separate sick employees: Employees who appear to have symptoms\u00a0(i.e., fever, cough, or shortness of breath) upon arrival at work or who become sick during the day should immediately be separated from other employees, customers, and visitors and sent home. If an employee is confirmed to have COVID-19 infection, employers should inform fellow employees of their possible exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace but maintain confidentiality as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The employer should instruct fellow employees about how to proceed based on the CDC Public Health Recommendations for Community-Related Exposure. Educate employees about how they can reduce the spread of COVID-19: Employees can take steps to protect themselves at work and at home. Older people and people with serious chronic medical conditions are at higher risk for complications. Follow the policies and procedures of your employer related to illness, cleaning and disinfecting, and work meetings and travel. Stay home if you are sick, except to get medical care. Learn what to do if you are sick. Inform your supervisor if you have a sick family member at home with COVID-19. Learn what to do if someone in your house is sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow. Throw used tissues in the trash and immediately wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol. Learn more about coughing and sneezing etiquette on the CDC website. Clean AND disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces such as workstations, keyboards, telephones, handrails, and doorknobs. Dirty surfaces can be cleaned with soap and water prior to disinfection. To disinfect, use products that meet EPA\u2019s criteria for use against SARS-CoV-2external icon, the cause of COVID-19, and are appropriate for the surface. Avoid using other employees\u2019 phones, desks, offices, or other work tools and equipment, when possible. If necessary, clean and disinfect them before and after use. Practice social distancing by avoiding large gatherings\u00a0and maintaining distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others when possible. Maintain Healthy Business Operations Identify a workplace coordinator who will be responsible for COVID-19 issues and their impact at the workplace. Implement flexible sick leave and supportive policies and practices. Ensure that sick leave policies are flexible and consistent with public health guidance and that employees are aware of and understand these policies. Maintain flexible policies that permit employees to stay home to care for a sick family member or take care of children due to school and childcare closures. Additional flexibilities might include giving advances on future sick leave and allowing employees to donate sick leave to each other. Employers that do not currently offer sick leave to some or all of their employees may want to draft non-punitive \u201cemergency sick leave\u201d policies. Employers should not require a positive COVID-19 test result or a healthcare provider\u2019s note for employees who are sick to validate their illness, qualify for sick leave, or to return to work. Healthcare provider offices and medical facilities may be extremely busy and not able to provide such documentation in a timely manner. Review human resources policies to make sure that policies and practices are consistent with public health recommendations and are consistent with existing state and federal workplace laws (for more information on employer responsibilities, visit the Department of Labor\u2019sexternal icon and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\u2019sexternal icon websites). Connect employees to employee assistance program (EAP) resources (if available) and community resources as needed. Employees may need additional social, behavioral, and other services, for example, to cope with the death of a loved one. Assess your essential functions and the reliance that others and the community have on your services or products. Be prepared to change your business practices if needed to maintain critical operations (e.g., identify alternative suppliers, prioritize existing customers, or temporarily suspend some of your operations if needed). Identify alternate supply chains for critical goods and services. Some good and services may be in higher demand or unavailable. Talk with companies that provide your business with contract or temporary employees about the importance of sick employees staying home and encourage them to develop non-punitive leave policies. Talk with business partners about your response plans. Share best practices with other businesses in your communities (especially those in your supply chain), chambers of commerce, and associations to improve community response efforts. Determine how you will operate if absenteeism spikes from increases in sick employees, those who stay home to care for sick family members, and those who must stay home to watch their children if dismissed from childcare programs and K-12 schools. Plan to monitor and respond to absenteeism at the workplace. Implement plans to continue your essential business functions in case you experience higher than usual absenteeism. Prepare to institute flexible workplace and leave policies. Cross-train employees to perform essential functions so the workplace can operate even if key employees are absent. Consider establishing policies and practices for social distancing. Social distancing should be implemented if recommended by state and local health authorities. Social distancing means avoiding large gatherings and maintaining distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others when possible (e.g., breakrooms and cafeterias). Strategies that business could use include: Implementing flexible worksites (e.g., telework) Implementing flexible work hours (e.g., staggered shifts) Increasing physical space between employees at the worksite Increasing physical space between employees and customers (e.g., drive through, partitions) Implementing flexible meeting and travel options (e.g., postpone non-essential meetings or events) Downsizing operations Delivering services remotely (e.g. phone, video, or web) Delivering products through curbside pick-up or delivery Employers with more than one business location are encouraged to provide local managers with the authority to take appropriate actions outlined in their COVID-19 response plan based on local conditions. Maintain a healthy work environment Consider improving the engineering controls using the building ventilation system. This may include some or all of the following activities: Increase ventilation rates. Increase the percentage of outdoor air that circulates into the system. Support respiratory etiquette and hand hygiene for employees, customers, and worksite visitors: Provide tissues and no-touch disposal receptacles. Provide soap and water in the workplace. If soap and water are not readily available, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer that is at least 60% alcohol. If hands are visibly dirty, soap and water should be chosen over hand sanitizer. Ensure that adequate supplies are maintained. Place hand sanitizers in multiple locations to encourage hand hygiene. Place posters that encourage hand hygiene to help stop the spread\u00a0at the entrance to your workplace and in other workplace areas where they are likely to be seen. Discourage handshaking \u2013 encourage the use of other noncontact methods of greeting. Direct employees to visit the coughing and sneezing etiquette and clean hands webpage for more information. Perform routine environmental cleaning and disinfection: Routinely clean and disinfect all frequently touched surfaces in the workplace, such as workstations, keyboards, telephones, handrails, and doorknobs. If surfaces are dirty, they should be cleaned using a detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection. For disinfection, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants should be effective. A list of products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19 is available herepdf iconexternal icon. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time, etc.). Discourage workers from using other workers\u2019 phones, desks, offices, or other work tools and equipment, when possible. If necessary, clean and disinfect them before and after use. Provide disposable wipes so that commonly used surfaces (for example, doorknobs, keyboards, remote controls, desks, other work tools and equipment) can be wiped down by employees before each use. To disinfect, use products that meet EPA\u2019s criteria for use against SARS-Cov-2external icon, the cause of COVID-19, and are appropriate for the surface. Perform enhanced cleaning and disinfection after persons suspected/confirmed to have COVID-19 have been in the facility: If a sick employee is suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19, follow the CDC cleaning and disinfection recommendations. Advise employees before traveling to take additional preparations: Check the CDC\u2019s Traveler\u2019s Health Notices for the latest guidance and recommendations for each country to which you will travel. Specific travel information for travelers going to and returning from countries with travel advisories, and information for aircrew, can be found on the CDC website. Advise employees to check themselves for symptoms\u00a0of COVID-19 (i.e., fever, cough, or shortness of breath) before starting travel and notify their supervisor and stay home if they are sick. Ensure employees who become sick while traveling or on temporary assignment understand that they should notify their supervisor and promptly call a healthcare provider for advice if needed. If outside the United States, sick employees should follow company policy for obtaining medical care or contact a healthcare provider or overseas medical assistance company to assist them with finding an appropriate healthcare provider in that country. A U.S. consular officer can help locate healthcare services. However, U.S. embassies, consulates, and military facilities do not have the legal authority, capability, and resources to evacuate or give medicines, vaccines, or medical care to private U.S. citizens overseas. Take care when attending meetings and gatherings: Carefully consider whether travel is necessary. Consider using videoconferencing or teleconferencing when possible for work-related meetings and gatherings. Consider canceling, adjusting, or postponing large work-related meetings or gatherings that can only occur in-person. When videoconferencing or teleconferencing is not possible, hold meetings in open, well-ventilated spaces.

Postpone elective procedures, surgeries, and non-urgent dental visits. Proactively communicate to both staff and patients the need for them to stay at home if sick. Know steps to take if a patient with COVID-19 symptoms enters your facility. What's NewRevisions were made on April 7, 2020 Description of risk to dental health care personnel (DHCP)1 when providing emergency care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recommendations for contacting patients prior to emergency dental care. Recommendations for providing emergency dental care to non-COVID-19 patients including engineering controls, work practices and infection control considerations. Potential exposure guidance. Contingency and crisis planning. During the COVID-19 pandemic, dental emergencies2 will arise and may require treatment by DHCP. DHCP should regularly consult their state dental boards or other regulating agencies for requirements specific to their jurisdictions, as information is changing rapidly. The following dental-specific recommendations should be used with CDC\u2019s Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for patients with COVID-19 and the Interim Additional Guidance for Outpatient and Ambulatory Care Settings: Responding to Community Transmission of COVID-19 in the United States. This information supplements, but does not replace, the general infection prevention and control recommendations for COVID-19. Background SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is thought to be spread primarily through respiratory droplets. Airborne transmission from person-to-person over long distances is unlikely. However, the contribution of aerosols, or droplet nuclei, to close proximity transmission is currently uncertain. The virus has been shown to survive in aerosols for hours and on surfaces for days. There are also indications that patients may be able to spread the virus while pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic. The practice of dentistry involves the use of rotary dental and surgical instruments such as handpieces or ultrasonic scalers and air-water syringes. These instruments create a visible spray that contains large particle droplets of water, saliva, blood, microorganisms, and other debris. This spatter travels only a short distance and settles out quickly, landing on the floor, nearby operatory surfaces, DHCP, or the patient. The spray also might contain certain aerosols. Surgical masks protect mucous membranes of the mouth and nose from droplet spatter, but they do not provide complete protection against inhalation of airborne infectious agents. There are currently no data available to assess the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during dental practice or to determine whether DHCP are adequately protected when providing dental treatment using Standard Precautions. To date in the United States, clusters of healthcare workers positive for COVID-19 have been identified in hospital settings and long-term care facilities, but no clusters have yet been reported in dental settings or personnel. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u2019s Guidance on Preparing Workplaces for COVID-19pdf iconexternal icon\u00a0places DHCP in the very high exposure risk category, as their jobs are those with high potential for exposure to known or suspected sources of the virus that causes COVID-19 during specific procedures. When practicing in the absence of Airborne Precautions, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during aerosol generating dental procedures cannot be eliminated. Caring for patients requiring Airborne Precautions is not possible in most dental settings as they are not designed for or equipped to provide this standard of care. For example, most dental settings do not have airborne infection isolation rooms or single-patient rooms, do not have a respiratory protection program, and do not routinely stock N95 respirators. Recommendations Postpone Elective Procedures, Surgeries, and Non-urgent Dental Visits Services should be limited to emergency visits only during this period of the pandemic. These actions help staff and patients stay safe, preserve personal protective equipment and patient care supplies, and expand available health system capacity. This recommendation aligns with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Adult Elective Surgery and Procedures Recommendationspdf iconexternal icon, which states to limit all non-essential planned surgeries and procedures, including dental, until further notice. Stay at Home if Sick Implement sick leave policies\u00a0for DHCP that are flexible, non-punitive, and consistent with public health guidance, allowing employees to stay home if they have symptoms of respiratory infection. Ask staff to stay home if they are sick and send staff home if they develop symptoms while at work. Telephone screen all patients for signs or symptoms of respiratory illness (fever3, cough, shortness of breath). If the patient reports signs or symptoms of a respiratory illness, avoid dental care. If possible, delay emergency dental care until the patient has recovered from the respiratory infection. Contact Patients Prior to Emergency Dental Treatment Telephone triage all patients in need of emergency dental care. Assess the patient\u2019s dental condition and determine whether the patient needs to be seen in the dental clinic. Use teleconferencing or teledentistry options as alternatives to in office care. If dental treatment can be delayed, provide patients with detailed home care instructions and any appropriate pharmaceuticals. Provision of Emergency Care to Patients with COVID-19 During the COVID-19 Pandemic If a patient arrives at your facility and is suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19, take the following actions: Defer dental treatment Give the patient a mask to cover his or her nose and mouth. If not acutely sick, send the patient home and instruct the patient to call a medical provider. If acutely sick (for example, has trouble breathing) refer the patient to a medical facility. If emergency dental care is medically necessary for a patient who has, or is suspected of having COVID-19, Airborne Precautions\u00a0(an isolation room with negative pressure relative to the surrounding area and use of an N95 filtering disposable respirator for persons entering the room) should be followed. Dental treatment should be provided in a hospital or other facility that can treat the patient using the appropriate precautions. Provision of Emergency Care to Patients Without COVID-19 in a Dental Clinic During the COVID-19 Pandemic If a patient must be seen in the dental clinic for emergency care, systematically assess the patient at the time of check-in. The patient should be asked about the presence of symptoms of a respiratory infection and history of travel to areas experiencing transmission of COVID-19 or contact with possible patients with COVID-19. If the patient is afebrile (temperature < 100.4\u02daF) and otherwise without symptoms consistent with COVID-19, then emergency dental care may be provided using appropriate engineering controls, work practices, and infection control practices. Engineering Controls and Work Practices Avoid aerosol generating procedures whenever possible. Avoid the use of dental handpieces and the air-water syringe. Use of ultrasonic scalers is not recommended during this time. Prioritize minimally invasive/atraumatic restorative techniques (hand instruments only). If aerosol generating procedures are necessary for emergency care, use four-handed dentistry, high evacuation suction and dental dams to minimize droplet spatter and aerosols. Infection Control Considerations Use the highest level of personal protective equipment (PPE) available: If available, wear gloves, a gown, eye protection (i.e., goggles or a disposable/reusable face shield that covers the front and sides of the face), and an N954 or higher-level respirator during emergency dental care for patients without COVID-19. Disposable respirators should be removed and discarded after exiting the patient\u2019s room or care area. Reusable eye protection must be cleaned and disinfected according to manufacturer\u2019s reprocessing instructions prior to re-use. Disposable eye protection should be discarded after use. Change gown if it becomes soiled. Remove and discard the gown in a dedicated container for waste or linen before leaving the patient room or care area. Disposable gowns should be discarded after use. Cloth gowns should be laundered after each use. If a respirator is not available, use a combination of a surgical mask and a full-face shield. Ensure that the mask is cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)external icon as a surgical mask. Surgical masks should be removed and discarded after exiting the patient\u2019s room or care area. Change surgical masks during patient treatment if the mask becomes wet. If the minimally acceptable combination of a surgical mask and a full-face shield is not available, do not perform any emergency dental care. Refer the patient to a clinician who has the appropriate PPE. Ensure DHCP practice strict adherence to hand hygiene, including: Before and after contact with patients. After contact with contaminated surfaces or equipment. After removing PPE. Clean and disinfect the room and equipment according to the Guidelines for Infection Control in Dental Health-Care Settings\u20142003 pdf icon Clean, disinfect, or discard the surface, supplies, or equipment located within 6 feet of symptomatic patients. Use products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claims\u2014refer to List Nexternal icon\u00a0on the EPA website for EPA-registered disinfectants that have qualified under EPA\u2019s emerging viral pathogens program from use against SARS-CoV-2. Screen all DHCP at the beginning of their shift for fever and respiratory symptoms. Document shortness of breath, new or change in cough, and sore throat. If they are ill, have them put on a facemask and leave the workplace. People with COVID-19 who have completed home isolation clearance\u00a0can receive emergency dental care. This is decided using two strategies: a non-test-based strategy, and a test-based-strategy: Non-test-based-strategy: At least 3 days (72 hours) have passed since recovery (resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and improvement in respiratory symptoms such as cough or shortness of breath) and at least 7 days have passed since symptoms first occurred. Test-based-strategy: Persons who have COVID-19 who have symptoms: Resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and improvement in respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) and negative results of an FDA Emergency Use Authorized molecular assay for COVID-19 from at least two consecutive nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected \u226524 hours apart5 (total of two negative specimens). Persons with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who have not had any symptoms: At least 7 days have passed since the date of the first positive COVID-19 diagnostic test and have had no subsequent illness. Potential Exposure Guidance Even when DHCP screen patients for respiratory infections, they may treat a dental emergency patient who is later confirmed to have COVID-19. DHCP should institute a policy to contact all patients who received emergency dental care in the dental setting 48 hours after receiving emergency care. DHCP should ask patients if they are exhibiting any signs or symptoms of COVID-19. If a patient reports signs or symptoms of COVID-19, refer the patient to their medical provider for assessment and follow CDC\u2019s Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure Guidance. Contingency and Crisis Planning Major distributors in the United States have reported shortages of PPE, especially surgical masks and respirators. The anticipated timeline for return to routine levels of PPE is not yet known. CDC has developed a series of strategies or options to optimize supplies of PPE in healthcare settings when there is limited supply, and a burn rate calculator\u00a0that provides information for healthcare facilities to plan and optimize the use of PPE for response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These policies are only intended to remain in effect during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. During severe resource limitations, consider excluding DHCP who may be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19, such as those of older age, those with chronic medical conditions, or those who may be pregnant, from performing emergency dental care.

Respirators are certified by the CDC/NIOSH, including those intended for use in healthcare. Respirator use must be in the context of a complete respiratory protection program in accordance with OSHA Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134external iconexternal icon). Healthcare Providers should be medically cleared and fit tested if using respirators with tight-fitting facepieces (e.g., a NIOSH-approved N95 respirator) and trained in the proper use of respirators, safe removal and disposal, and medical contraindications to respirator use. 5All test results should be final before isolation is ended.

Ambulatory care settings are where health services or acute care services are provided on an outpatient basis and can include community health centers, urgent care centers, retail clinics co-located in pharmacies, grocery stores, or mass merchants, hospital-based outpatient clinics, non-hospital-based clinics and physician offices, and public health clinics. These settings, particularly those which offer primary care services, play an important role in the healthcare system\u2019s response to the COVID-19 outbreak. This guidance reflects the need to 1) minimize disease transmission to patients, healthcare personnel (HCP) and others, 2) identify persons with presumptive COVID-19 disease and implement a triage procedure to assign appropriate levels of care, 3) reduce negative impacts on emergency department and hospital bed capacity and 4) maximize the efficiency of personal protective equipment (PPE) utilization across the community health system while protecting healthcare personnel. Public health guidance will shift as the COVID-19 outbreak evolves. All healthcare facilities should be aware of updates to local and state public health recommendations. These recommendations should be used with the CDC\u2019s Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings. This information is provided to clarify COVID-19 infection prevention and control (IPC) recommendations that are specific to ambulatory care settings. This information complements, but does not replace, the general IPC recommendations for COVID-19. Key Considerations for Healthcare Facilities Currently there are no FDA-approved medications to treat or vaccines to prevent COVID-19. Therefore, community approaches to slowing transmission such as social distancing, and reducing face-to-face contact with potential COVID-19 cases are needed to slow disease transmission and reduce the number of people who get sick. In each healthcare facility, the primary goals include: Provision of the appropriate level of necessary medical care. Protecting healthcare personnel and non-COVID-19 patients from infection. Preparing for a potential surge in patients with respiratory infection. Preparing for PPE and staffing shortages. Top of Page Actions to Take in Response to Community Transmission of COVID-19 As a public health action to preserve staff, PPE, and patient care supplies and to ensure safety for patients and HCP, facilities should delay elective ambulatory provider visits and implement service delivery models such as telemedicine. (See information below under \u201cShifting Healthcare Delivery Modes during a COVID-19 Outbreak in the United States\u201d and American College of Physicians: Telehealth Resourcesexternal icon). Provider visits related to prevention services that cannot be performed virtually such as routine adult immunizations, lipid screenings and cancer screenings should be postponed unless the risks of postponement are believed to outweigh the benefits. For information on pediatric immunizations see Maintaining Childhood Immunizations During COVID-19 Pandemic Explore alternatives to face-to-face triage and visits for the acutely ill. The following options can reduce in-person healthcare visits and prevent transmission of respiratory viruses in your facility: Instruct patients to use available telephone advice lines, patient portals, and on-line self-assessment tools, or call and speak to an office/clinic HCP if they become ill with symptoms such as fever, cough, or shortness of breath. Identify sufficient HCP to conduct telephonic and telehealth interactions with patients. Develop protocols so that HCP can triage and assess patients prior to entering the facility or immediately upon entering. Implement algorithms (Phone Advice Line Tools pdf icon[11 pages]) to identify which patients have respiratory symptoms that may be due to COVID-19 and need to be advised to seek 9-1-1 transport, go to an emergency department, or come to your facility. Implement algorithms to identify which patients with respiratory symptoms that may be due to COVID-19 can be managed by telephone and advised to stay home: Assess the patient\u2019s ability to engage in home monitoring, their ability to safely isolate at home, and the risk of transmission to others in the patient\u2019s home environment. Provide clear instructions to caregivers and sick persons regarding home care and when and how to access the healthcare system for face-to-face care or urgent/emergent conditions. If possible, identify HCP who can monitor those patients at home with daily \u201ccheck-ins\u201d using telephone calls, text, patient portals, or other means. Engage local community organizations and home health services to assist patients who are treated at home and may need support services such as delivery of food, medication and other goods. Prepare your facility to safely triage and manage patients with respiratory illness, including COVID-19. Become familiar with infection prevention and control guidance for managing COVID-19 patients and preparation steps. Place visual alerts such as signs and posters at entrances and in strategic places providing instruction on hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, and cough etiquette (Coronavirus Factsheets). Ensure supplies are available such as tissues, hand soap, waste receptacles, and alcohol-based hand sanitizer in readily accessible areas. Ensure facemasks are available at triage for patients with respiratory symptoms. Create an area to physically separate patients with respiratory symptoms. Ideally patients would be at least 6 feet apart in waiting areas. If facility lacks a waiting area, then designated areas or waiting lines should be created by partitioning or signage. To reduce crowding in waiting rooms, consider asking patients waiting to be seen to remain outside (e.g., stay in their vehicles, if applicable) until they are called into the facility for their appointment or set up triage booths to screen patients safely. Work with local and state public health organizations, healthcare coalitions, and other local partners to understand the impact and spread of the outbreak in your area and any crisis standards of careexternal icon initiatives being implemented. Ambulatory care settings may also be leveraged to allow for diversion from hospital emergency departments of non-respiratory illnesses or minor trauma not likely to require hospitalization. If your facility is called upon to screen and diagnose COVID-19, designate HCP who will be responsible. Ensure they are trained on infection prevention and control guidance for COVID-19 and proper use of PPE as well as any local guidance for testing strategies including implementation of, or referrals to, mobile or drive-thru testing venues. Monitor HCP and ensure maintenance of essential healthcare facility staff and operations: Facilities should implement sick leave policies that are non-punitive, flexible, and consistent with public health policies and allow ill healthcare personnel (HCP) to stay home. HCP should be reminded to not report to work when they are ill. Be aware of recommended work restrictions and monitoring based on staff exposure to COVID-19 patients. Do not require a healthcare provider\u2019s note for employees who are sick with respiratory symptoms before returning to work. Advise employees to check for any signs of illness before reporting to work each day and notify their supervisor if they become ill. Consider screening staff for fever or respiratory symptoms before entering the facility. Make contingency plans for increased absenteeism caused by employee illness or illness in employees\u2019 family members that would require them to stay home. Planning for absenteeism could include extending hours, cross-training current employees, or hiring temporary employees. Plan to optimize your facility\u2019s supply of PPE in the event of shortages. Identify flexible mechanisms to procure additional supplies when needed. Top of Page Other Considerations for Ambulatory Care Settings Consider reaching out to patients who may be a higher risk of COVID-19-related complications such as the elderly, those with medical co-morbidities, and potentially other persons who are at higher risk for complications from respiratory diseases, such as pregnant women, to ensure adherence to current medications and therapeutic regimens, confirm they have sufficient medication refills, and provide instructions to notify their provider by phone if they become ill. Eliminate patient penalties for cancellations and missed appointments related to respiratory illness. Special considerations for clinics that are co-located in larger stores such as pharmacies, grocery stores, or other retail outlets Post signs at the door instructing clinic patients with respiratory illness to return to their vehicles (or remain outside if pedestrians) and call the telephone number for the clinic so that proper triage can be performed before they enter the store. It may be possible to manage patients with mild symptoms telephonically and send them home with instructions for care. Clinic patients with respiratory illness that need to be seen should be told to wait outside the store until they can be brought directly into a clinic visit room or a designated waiting room. Facemasks should be provided, ideally prior to entering the store. Where possible, provide separate entrances for all clinic patients. Otherwise create a clear path from the main door to the clinic, with partitions or other physical barriers (if feasible), to minimize contact with other customers. Shifting healthcare delivery modes during a COVID-19 outbreak in the United StatesSeveral major impacts can be anticipated during a severe outbreak that could affect the operations of healthcare facilities. These include surges in patients seeking care, the potential for workforce absenteeism for personal or family illness, and effects from community mitigation approaches such as school closures. Healthcare facilities will likely need to adjust the way they triage, assess, and care for patients by using methods that do not rely on face-to-face care. Facilities can reduce exposure of HCP to ill persons and minimize surge on facilities by shifting practices to triaging and assessing ill patients (including those affected by COVID-19 and patients with other conditions) remotely using nurse advice lines, provider \u201cvisits\u201d by telephone, text monitoring systems, video conferences, or other telehealth and telemedicine methods. Many clinics and medical offices already use these methods to triage and manage patients after hours and as part of usual practices. Recent reports suggest that approximately 80% of COVID-19 patients (of all ages) have experienced mild illness (Wu et al 2020external icon).\u00a0 Managing persons at home who are ill with mild disease can reduce the strain on healthcare systems, however, these patients will need careful triage and monitoring. Promoting the increased use of telehealth Healthcare facilities can increase the use of telephone management and other remote methods of triaging, assessing, and caring for all patients to decrease the volume of persons seeking care in facilities. If a formal telehealth system is not available, healthcare providers can still communicate with patients by telephone instead of in person visits which will reduce the number of those who seek face-to-face care. Health plans, healthcare systems, and insurers/payors should communicate with beneficiaries to promote the availability of covered telehealth, telemedicine, or nurse advice line services. Shifts in the way that healthcare is delivered during a COVID-19 outbreak response will be complex. Thorough and consistent communications between all components of the public health and healthcare system will be needed in every community. Providers in medical offices, clinics, and other outpatient settings should be informed and know their roles as they evolve. Pre-hospital care by emergency management services (EMS) and public-safety answering points (PSAPs) will also need to be coordinated and consistent with current transport guidance so they can conduct in-home assessments and triage per local guidance. Additional telehealth information by region and state can be found at the National Consortium of Telehealth Resource Centersexternal icon and the Center for Connected Health Policyexternal icon).

{"title": "Homelessness and COVID-19 FAQs", "time": "2020-4-7 00:00:00", "author": "", "link": "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/homeless-shelters/faqs.html", "content": "Frequently Asked Questions Are people experiencing homelessness at risk of COVID-19? People who are homeless are at risk of COVID-19. Homeless services are often provided in congregate settings, which could facilitate the spread of infection. Because many people who are homeless are older adults or have underlying medical conditions, they may also be at higher risk for severe disease than the general population. Health departments and healthcare facilities should be aware that people who are homeless are a particularly vulnerable group. If possible, identifying non-congregate settings where those at highest risk can stay may help protect them from COVID-19. How can people experiencing homelessness protect themselves when COVID-19 is spreading in their community? Many of the recommendations to prevent COVID-19\u00a0may be difficult for a person experiencing homelessness to do. Although it may not be possible to avoid certain crowded locations (such as shelters), people who are homeless should try to avoid other crowded public settings and public transportation. If possible, they should use take-away options for food. As is true for everyone, they should maintain a distance of about 6 feet (two arms\u2019 length) from other people. They also should wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds as often as possible, and cover their coughs and sneezes. What should a person who is experiencing homelessness do if they have symptoms consistent with COVID-19? Any person experiencing homelessness with symptoms consistent with COVID-19\u00a0(fever, cough, or shortness of breath) should alert their service providers (such as case managers, shelter staff, and other care providers). These staff will help the individual understand how to isolate themselves and identify options for medical care as needed. Where can people experiencing homelessness be tested for COVID-19? If they meet criteria for testing, people experiencing homelessness will access COVID-19 testing through a healthcare provider. Local public health and healthcare facilities need to determine the best location for this testing in coordination with homeless healthcare clinics and street medicine clinics. Where should a person who is experiencing homelessness stay if they are suspected to have COVID-19 or if they have tested positive for COVID-19? Those with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should stay in a place where they can best be isolated from other people to prevent spreading the infection. Local health departments, housing authorities, homeless service systems and healthcare facilities should plan to identify locations to isolate those with known or suspected COVID-19 until they meet the criteria to end isolation. Isolation housing could be units designated by local authorities or shelters determined to have capacity to sufficiently isolate these people. If no other options are available, homeless service providers\u00a0 should plan for how they can help people isolate themselves while efforts are underway to provide additional support.\u00a0 Please see the Interim Guidance for Homeless Service Providers and Interim Guidance for People Experiencing Unsheltered Homelessness\u00a0for more information. Can homeless service providers accept donations? Homeless service providers can accept donations during community spread of COVID-19, but general infection control precautions should be taken. Request that donors not donate if they are sick. Set up donation drop-off points to encourage social distancing between shelter workers and those donating. According to usual procedures, launder donated clothing, sheets, towels, or other fabrics on high heat settings, and disinfect items that are nonporous, such as items made of plastic. Food donations should be shelf-stable, and shelter staff should take usual food-related infection prevention precautions. For more information about COVID-19 and food, see the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s website on Food Safety and COVID-19external icon. For further information on cleaning and disinfection, see here. Should homeless shelters screen incoming guests? Homeless shelters can screen incoming guests for symptoms of respiratory infections. Any person with symptoms of COVID-19 should be provided with a facemask, if available. In accordance with the Interim Guidance for Homeless Service Providers, they should then be directed to a predetermined area. This may be an alternate location or an area within the shelter. Ideally, these guests would stay in individual rooms. If individual rooms are not available, consider using a large, well-ventilated room where beds at least 6 feet apart with temporary barriers between them. Request that all guests sleep head-to-toe. At this time, it is not recommended to screen incoming guests for COVID-19 using laboratory tests unless directed to do so by local health authorities. For information about staff/volunteer illness, please refer to the Interim Guidance for Homeless Service Providers. Should homeless shelters close? Homeless shelters serve a critical function in our communities. Shelters should stay open unless homeless service providers, health departments, and housing authorities have determined together that a shelter needs to close. Should homeless encampments be cleared? Connecting people to stable housing should continue to be a priority. However, if individual housing options are not available, allow people who are living in encampments to remain where they are.\u00a0 Encourage people living in encampments to increase space between people and provide hygiene resources in accordance with the Interim Guidance for People Experiencing Unsheltered Homelessness."}
{"title": "People with Disabilities", "time": "2020-4-7 00:00:00", "author": "", "link": "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-disabilities.html", "content": "COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads, the severity of illness it causes, and to what extent it may spread in the United States. Disability alone may not be related to higher risk for getting COVID-19 or having severe illness. Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19.\u00a0 However, some people with disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection or severe illness because of their underlying medical conditions.\u00a0 All people seem to be at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 if they have serious underlying chronic medical conditions\u00a0like chronic lung disease, a serious heart condition, or a weakened immune system. Adults with disabilities are three times more likely than adults without disabilities to have heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or cancer than adults without disabilities. You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed. Disability Groups and Risk If you have one of the disability types listed below, you might be at increased risk of becoming infected or having unrecognized illness.\u00a0 You should discuss your risk of illness with your healthcare provider. People who have limited mobility or who cannot avoid coming into close contact with others who may be infected, such as direct support providers and family members People who have trouble understanding information or practicing preventive measures, such as hand washing and social distancing People who may not be able to communicate symptoms of illness Protect Yourself If you or someone you care for are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, take steps to prevent getting sick. In addition to practicing everyday preventive actions, people with disabilities who have direct support providers can help protect themselves from respiratory illness in the following ways: Ask your direct support provider if they are experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19 or if they have been in contact with someone who has COVID-19 Tell your direct service provider to Wash their hands when they enter your home and before and after touching you (e.g., dressing, bathing/showering, transferring, toileting, feeding), handling tissues, or when changing linens or doing laundry. Learn more about proper handwashing. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces (e.g., counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, bedside tables), and equipment such as wheelchairs, scooters, walkers, canes, oxygen tanks and tubing, communication boards and other assistive devices. Refer to CDC\u2019s General Recommendations for Routine Cleaning and Disinfections of Households. Prepare There are some additional things people with disabilities can do to prepare during the COVID-19 outbreak: Plan what you will do if you or your direct support provider gets sick. Create a contact list of family, friends, neighbors and local service agencies that can provide support in case you or your direct support provider becomes ill\u00a0or unavailable. Plan at least two ways of communicating from home and work that can be used rapidly in an emergency (e.g., landline phone, cell phone, text-messaging, email).\u00a0 Write down this information and keep it with you. Have enough household items and groceries so that you will be comfortable staying home for a few weeks, at least a 30-day supply of over the counter and prescription medicines and any medical equipment or supplies that you might need.\u00a0Some health plans allow for a 90-day refill on prescription medications. Consider discussing this option with your healthcare provider. Make a photocopy of prescriptions, as\u00a0this may help in obtaining medications in an emergency situation. About COVID-19 Coronavirus disease is a respiratory illness that can spread from person to person. The virus is thought to spread mainly between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet) through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It is also possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or eyes. For more information go to CDC\u2019s Fact Sheet- What you need to know about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)pdf icon. Risk of infection with COVID-19 is higher for people who are in close contact with someone known to have COVID-19, such as healthcare workers, direct support providers, and household members. Other people at higher risk for infection are those who live or have recently been in an area with ongoing spread of COVID-19. Prevention and Treatment There is currently no vaccine to protect against COVID-19.\u00a0 The best way to prevent infection is to take everyday preventive actions, like avoiding close contact with people who are sick and washing your hands often.\u00a0 There is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19. People with COVID-19\u00a0can seek medical care to help relieve symptoms."}

{"title": "Strategic priority infection prevention and control (IPC) activities for containment and prevention of COVID-19 cases at healthcare facilities in non-US settings", "time": "2020-4-6 00:00:00", "author": "", "link": "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/non-us-settings/ipc-healthcare-facilities-non-us.html", "content": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is working closely with international partners to respond to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. CDC provides technical assistance to help other countries increase their ability to prevent, detect, and respond to health threats, including COVID-19. This document is provided by CDC and is intended for use in non-US healthcare settings. 1. Use of this document This document is intended to guide national-level coordination, healthcare facilities, and implementing partners in considering and planning high-priority IPC activities to prevent healthcare-associated transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 virus). Aspects of this document are relevant for all countries, but a focus is placed on priorities for low- and middle-income settings given resource constraints. The goal of IPC activities in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) response is to support the maintenance of essential healthcare services by preventing healthcare-associated transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among healthcare workers (HCW) and patients. This requires: Rapid identification of suspect cases Immediate isolation and referral for testing Safe clinical management Adherence to standard IPC precautions This document focuses on implementation of rapid identification of COVID-19 in healthcare facilities, which forms the basis for subsequent isolation, testing and management decisions. Planning and coordination of activities should be conducted in collaboration with emergency response officials, in addition to relevant public health officials (e.g., Ministry of Health, sub-national health offices, facility administration). This document addresses specific details on prioritized activities around rapid identification of COVID-19 in healthcare facilities under four different epidemiological scenarios of COVID-19 transmission. However, national and sub-national public health authorities and healthcare facilities in all countries should be doing certain core activities to support and prepare for the start of any of the activities outlined in section 5, regardless of the current state of COVID-19 transmission in the country. 2. National activities to support and enable prioritized facility IPC activities National and sub-national public health authorities play a critical role in enabling priority IPC activities at healthcare facilities. Specific areas of focus for national and sub-national authorities should include: Development of national or sub-national policies and guidance on implementation of priority activities outlined in section 5 of this document in healthcare facilities (e.g., HCW screening, triage at facilities, isolation and cohorting in facilities, facilitating safe home care for cases with mild symptoms, movement and monitoring of exposed HCW) Linkage of Ministry of Health and sub-national IPC focal points to COVID-19 preparedness planning work (e.g., epidemiology and laboratory pillars) Development of forecasting plans for personal protective equipment (PPE) and other IPC consumables (e.g., alcohol-based hand rub) that prioritize: Healthcare system needs Development of plans for stockpiling PPE Deploying stocks when need arises Communication with facilities to ensure continuity of stocks Assessment of IPC readiness for facility inpatient areas for priority activities (outlined in section 5) and use this information to do the following: Define national referral networks to direct suspected or confirmed cases to designated, prepared hospitals Note: this is most relevant during containment phase of the response (epidemiologic scenarios 1 and 2, below) when there are relatively few cases that are epidemiologically linked Strengthen priority IPC areas at all hospitals, starting with highest risk, in preparation for limited and widespread community transmission Development of national policies and procedures to avoid overwhelming healthcare facilities from influx of suspected COVID-19 cases, particularly mild cases. This should include: Consideration of remote triage capabilities for suspected COVID-19 cases through hotlines, telemedicine or other modalities Communicating with symptomatic contacts of known COVID-19 cases to alert designated authorities in advance of presenting for medical care Development of messaging on this topic for healthcare facilities and general population (e.g., stay at home except to get medical care) Ensuring the availability of COVID-19 laboratory testing in country and linkages to healthcare facilities that may need testing services Development of training materials on priority IPC activities to prevent healthcare-associated spread of COVID-19 Dissemination of training materials toto professional societies, sub-national public health authorities, healthcare facilities, and front-line healthcare workers 3. Core facility IPC activities regardless of epidemiologic scenario Develop plans to carry out actions outlined in section 5 in order to prevent the spread of acute respiratory infections (ARI), such as COVID-19, within the facility Develop SOPs for environmental cleaning procedures, particularly for the triage and isolation areas where suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients will be placed Develop staffing plans to adequately staff isolation areas and consider whether cohorting staff is feasible Develop contingency plans for PPE shortages and other IPC consumable (e.g., alcohol-based hand rub) shortages in collaboration with national and sub-national public health authorities Develop communication plans to ensure adequate internal and external communication regarding COVID-19 Educate HCW, patients, and visitors on COVID-19 signs, symptoms, and required IPC protocols Develop policies for visitor restriction (e.g., restrict visitors who are sick with ARI) Develop policies to identify and risk stratify HCW exposed to COVID-19 cases and monitor their movement and return to work Establish communication channels between healthcare facilities and public health authorities who can facilitate linkages with laboratory testing and epidemiology/contact tracing 4. Epidemiologic scenarios No known cases in country Confirmed cases, but no known community transmission If secondary cases present, all are linked to other confirmed cases Confirmed cases, limited community transmission Limited amount of unlinked cases identified in the community Confirmed cases, widespread community transmission Many unlinked cases identified in the community Note: there may be situations within a country whereby different geographic areas meet different scenario criteria. Ministries of Health, in coordination with relevant stakeholders, should consider the appropriateness and feasibility of applying a single set of prioritized IPC activities across the country matched to the most severe transmission scenario met versus implementing multiple sets of prioritized IPC activities in differently affected geographic units. Experience in this pandemic has shown that once a region is at scenario 2 (confirmed cases, no known community transmission), aggressive testing strategies of undiagnosed respiratory infections may quickly reveal underlying community transmission. This can result in a rapid progression to scenario 4 (widespread community transmission), sometimes within a little as a week. Thus it is absolutely critical that countries prepare aggressively for future epidemiologic scenarios even as the implement activities for their current situation. Ministries of Health and healthcare facilities must act quickly once cases are identified to prevent and prepare for scenario 4 (widespread community transmission). 5. Prioritized IPC activities for prevention and containment of COVID-19 cases, by epidemiologic scenario Prioritized IPC activities for prevention and containment of COVID-19 cases, by epidemiologic scenario Domain Priority Activities Rationale Scenario 1: No known cases in country Limiting entry of healthcare workers with suspected COVID-19 Passive identification of HCWs at inpatient and outpatient healthcare facilities who are ill with ARI Reinforce messages about not coming to work if sick, especially with ARI HCWs can spread COVID-19 in healthcare facilities if they are an unknown case. This may be an early to medium indicator of introduction of COVID-19 in healthcare system. Identification of inpatients with suspected COVID-19 Encouraging staff to maintain a high suspicion for COVID-19 if seeing inpatients with compatible symptoms and no other clear etiology of illness AND inquire about any epidemiologic links (e.g., travel history, contact with confirmed case). Systematic screening of inpatients is a resource intensive activity and ARI/healthcare-associated pneumonia is common. However, it is important that clinicians maintain a high level of suspicion for COVID-19 when there is a compatible presentation and inquire about any epidemiologic links since this may be an early sign of introduction to the healthcare facility. Triage at initial healthcare facility encounter Strengthen IPC during routine triage to ensure Standard precautions are used (e.g., hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene) and separation of ARI patients from other patients in the waiting room/triage area. Encourage intake and medical staff to have a high suspicion for COVID-19 if seeing patients with symptoms and travel to a country with widespread community transmission or with known contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case. Carrying out systematic screening for COVID-19 at all healthcare facilities in a country without cases is prohibitively resource intensive with a low return on investment (i.e., low likelihood of identifying a confirmed case). Limitations in laboratory testing can make implementing systematic triage for COVID-19 at inpatient facilities in countries with no known cases very challenging. Scenario 2: Confirmed cases, but no known community transmission Limiting entry of healthcare workers with suspected COVID-19 Same as Scenario 1 with enhancement of detection (e.g., policy for HCW to call supervisor if sick or for supervisor to report if an employee does not come to work). Once cases are identified in a country, enhancing identification of ill HCWs is necessary. Identification of inpatients with suspected COVID-19 Same as scenario 1 with enhanced passive detection if feasible (e.g., clinician reminders to consider COVID-19 in inpatients disseminated daily) Identification of ARI clusters within a healthcare facility builds on healthcare epidemiology that should be ongoing in hospitals to review clusters of infections in time and space. During COVID-19, special attention should be paid to clusters of ARI in inpatients that might suggest a healthcare-associated COVID-19 transmission Triage at initial healthcare facility encounter Strengthen basic triage as in Scenario 1 Strengthen linkages to contact tracing teams to ensure contacts of known COVID-19 cases can access designated healthcare points if they become symptomatic in order to prevent known symptomatic contacts from showing up at unprepared healthcare facilities. Focus at this stage should be on ensuring that symptomatic contacts of confirmed cases are directed to present at healthcare facilities prepared to receive them. This is the priority activity in order to prevent COVID-19 patients from arriving unrecognized at healthcare facilities. Carrying out widespread systematic COVID-19 triage at healthcare facilities when cases are all epidemiologically linked is of lower priority. Limiting entry of visitors with suspected COVID-19 Implement policies to restrict visitors for patients with ARI admitted to healthcare facilities Passive detection of ill visitors, e.g., encouragement of visitors to not enter facility if they have ARI Visitors to healthcare facilities have the potential to introduce COVID-19, particularly when they are close contacts of patients with suspected COVID-19 Scenario 3: Confirmed cases, limited community transmission Limiting entry of healthcare workers with suspected COVID-19 Same as Scenario 2 AND in high-risk facilities , consider implementing active screening to identify HCWs with ARI prior to work With growing transmission comes higher utility in expanding to active screening of HCWs, especially as community transmission widens and HCWs become increasingly likely to have contact with cases outside the healthcare facility Identification of inpatients with suspected COVID-19 Same as scenario 2 Same as rationale in scenario 2 above. Triage at initial healthcare facility encounter Strengthen IPC during routine triage as in Scenario 1 Systematic screening of patients presenting to a healthcare facility to identify COVID-19 suspect cases guided by WHO, or country-specific, case definition Once there is documented unlinked transmission in the country or geographic region, the ability to rely on identifying symptomatic contacts and sending to prepared facilities becomes less efficacious as a strategy to prevent unidentified COVID-19 cases from entering a healthcare facility. Systematic triage should be carried out widely in facilities with access to laboratory testing as this will allow the facility to quickly confirm cases for the purposes of isolation. In areas without laboratory testing capacity, systematic triage should be carried out only at facilities that at are at high risk (e.g., have a high likelihood of having cases) and can consider using a highly specific case definition (to avoid non COVID-19 cases being isolated with non-cases) Limiting entry of visitors with suspected COVID-19 Visitor restrictions same as Scenario 1, consider expanding to eliminating visitors for all inpatients Consider implementation of active screening of visitors with ARI with non-entry for ill visitors Visitors to healthcare facilities have the potential to introduce COVID-19, particularly when they are close contacts of patients with suspected COVID-19 Scenario 4: Confirmed cases, widespread community transmission Limiting entry of healthcare workers with suspected COVID-19 Active screening to identify ill HCWs prior to work With widespread community transmission, as in prior outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, HCWs are high risk for becoming cases. In this scenario HCW should be actively screened prior to shifts to avoid further transmission of COVID-19 if ill. Identification of inpatients with suspected COVID-19 Same as scenario 2 with consideration of screening of inpatients for COVID-19, if resources allow. With increased community transmission the likelihood of missing patients with COVID-19 at triage becomes more likely as does the likelihood of healthcare-associated transmission. Thus, increased attention to single cases of possible COVID-19 arising among inpatients should be prioritized. Triage at initial healthcare facility encounter Strengthen basic triage IPC as in Scenario 1 Systematic evaluation of every patient at triage as outlined in Scenario 3 With widespread community transmission the likelihood of finding positive cases at triage is highest, and thus, the highest priority should be placed on implementing functional triage at initial healthcare facility encounter. This will be challenging in places without access to laboratory services. Limiting entry of visitors with suspected COVID-19 Active screening of all visitors to the hospital for illness consistent with COVID-19 with non-admission for sick visitors Visitors to healthcare facilities have the potential to introduce COVID-19, particularly when they are close contacts of patients with suspected COVID-19 1 High-risk facilities should be defined by public health authorities considering: proximity to facilities or communities with known COVID-19 cases, including those across administrative or international borders as well as prioritizing facilities seeing large numbers of patients at high risk of being a COVID-19 case and where introduction would be highly disruptive (e.g., large referral hospitals) 6. Additional considerations for inpatient facilities with admitted cases of confirmed COVID-19 Regardless of epidemiologic scenario in a country, once an inpatient facility is housing suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases, specific IPC precautions for isolation will apply. These are outlined by the World Health Organization and accessible at the links below. Pursuant to this document, facilities with confirmed cases may need to carry out prioritized activities from other epidemiologic scenarios even if those scenarios do not represent the country-wide COVID-19 situation. This could include, for instance, a hospital with confirmed COVID-19 cases choosing to conduct active screening of healthcare workers for signs and symptoms of COVID-19, despite this not being listed under the routine priority activities in that country\u2019s epidemiologic scenario. 7.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness that can spread from person to person. It spreads between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet) and through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Symptoms\u00a0can include fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, which may appear 2-14 days after exposure. These steps are recommended to protect employees and prepare your business for disruption: Identify a workplace coordinator who will be responsible for COVID-19 issues and their impact at the workplace. Examine policies for leave, telework, and employee compensation. Leave policies should be flexible and non-punitive, and allow sick employees to stay home and away from co-workers. Leave policies should also account for employees who need to stay home with their children if there are school or childcare closures, or to care for sick family members. When possible, use flexible worksites (e.g., telework) and flexible work hours (e.g., staggered shifts) to help establish policies and practices for social distancing (maintaining distance of approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) between employees and others, especially if social distancing is recommended by state and local health authorities. Review your leave policies with all employees and provide information about available employee assistance services. Share information on steps they can take to protect themselves at work and at home, and any available Identify essential employees and business functions, and other critical inputs such as raw materials, suppliers, subcontractor services/products, and logistics required to maintain business operations. Explore ways you can continue business operations if there are disruptions. Prepare business continuity plans for significant absenteeism, supply chain disruptions, or changes in the way you need to conduct business. Establish an emergency communications plan. Identify key contacts (with back-ups), chain of communications (including suppliers and customers), and processes for tracking and communicating about business and employee status. Share your response plans with employees and clearly communicate expectations.

The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person: Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. Recent studies indicate that the virus can be spread by people before they develop symptoms (pre-symptomatic) or who never develop symptoms (asymptomatic).\u00a0 It also may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. However, this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. Older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions may be at higher risk for more serious complications\u00a0from COVID-19. As an airline customer service representative or gate agent, how can I protect myself?As a customer service representative or gate agent, potential sources of exposure could include assisting a person with COVID-19 in close contact or handling passenger items, such as baggage, boarding passes, identification documents, credit cards, and mobile devices. Limit close contact with others by maintaining a distance of at least 6 feet, when possible. Provide a facemask to any visibly sick person you are assisting if one is available and they can tolerate it. Ask them to cover their mouth and nose with tissues when coughing or sneezing. Follow employer\u2019s guidelines for additional steps as required. Avoid handling of passenger and airline crew boarding passes, luggage, identification documents, credit cards and mobile devices, where possible. Allow passengers to hold their own documents and scan their own boarding pass or mobile device. Practice routine cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched surfaces such as workstations, keyboards, touchscreens, printers, and computers, following the directions on the cleaning product\u2019s label. Follow your employer\u2019s normal guidance for handling service/support animals. Proper hand hygiene is an important infection control measure. Wash your hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol. Key times to clean hands include: Before, during, and after preparing food Before eating food After using the toilet After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing Additional workplace-specific times to clean hands include: Before and after work shifts Before and after work breaks After touching frequently touched surfaces After interacting with a customer who is visibly ill Do not touch your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands. What steps should my employer take?Your employer should have a COVID-19 health and safety plan to protect employees. This plan should be shared with you and your coworkers. Your employer should: Take steps to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 if an employee is sick. Actively encourage sick employees to stay home. Sick employees should not return to work until the criteria to\u00a0discontinue home isolation\u00a0are met, in consultation with healthcare providers and state and local health departments. Provide information on who to contact if employees become sick. Implement flexible sick leave and supportive policies and practices. Consider drafting non-punitive \u201cemergency sick leave\u201d policies if sick leave is not offered to some or all employees. Develop policies for responding to the identification of sick passengers, crew, or coworkers. Designate someone to be responsible for responding to COVID-19 concerns. Employees should know who this person is and how to contact them. Provide employees with accurate information about COVID-19, how it spreads, and risk of exposure. Provide training on proper handwashing\u00a0practices and other routine infection control precautions. This will help prevent the spread of many diseases, including COVID-19. Provide employees with access to soap, clean running water, and drying materials or alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol at their worksite. Provide disposable disinfectant wipes so that commonly touched surfaces (such as workstations, keyboards, touchscreens, printers, and computers) can be wiped down by employees. For disinfection, use products that meet EPA\u2019s criteria for use against SARS-CoV-2external icon, diluted household bleach solutions, or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol, and are appropriate for the surface. Follow manufacturer\u2019s directions for use. Provide tissues and no-touch disposal receptacles for use by employees. Conduct frequent cleaning of employee break rooms, rest areas, and other common areas. Place posters that encourage staying home when sick, cough and sneeze etiquette, and good hand hygiene\u00a0at the entrance to the workplace and in other workplace areas where they are likely to be seen.

As an aircraft maintenance worker, how can I protect myself?As an aircraft maintenance worker, you could be exposed to COVID-19 in situations such as when you have close contact with someone with COVID-19 or when you touch surfaces while repairing aircraft interiors and lavatories that have been touched or handled by a person with COVID-19. Limit close contact with others by maintaining a distance of at least 6 feet, when possible. Practice routine cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched surfaces, following the directions on the cleaning product\u2019s label. Use gloves whenever you touch surfaces contaminated by body fluids. Proper hand hygiene is an important infection control measure. Wash your hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol. Key times to clean hands in general include: Before, during, and after preparing food Before eating food After using the toilet After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing Additional times to clean hands on the job include: Before and after work shifts Before and after work breaks After touching frequently touched surfaces After removing any personal protective equipment (PPE) After performing maintenance tasks such as handling untreated human waste Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth. Recommendations based on work tasks: Interior Work: Wear your normally required PPE, if applicable, when making repairs in the passenger cabin area. Do not use compressed air or water sprays to clean surfaces contacted by passengers, as these techniques may aerosolize potentially infectious material. If cleaning is required before you make repairs, first review CDC cleaning guidance for Airlines and Airline Crew: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and contact your employer for additional guidance. Air Filter Replacement: Wear your normally required PPE, if applicable. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s filter replacement schedule. When replacing air filters (including HEPA filters): Avoid hitting, dropping, or shaking the filter. Do not use compressed air to clean a filter. This will keep materials in the filter from becoming airborne. Dispose of the used filter and gloves in a sealed plastic bag. Clean your hands when the task is finished. Waste and Wastewater Handling: Follow standard practices when performing work tasks that could expose you to untreated waste and wastewater. Untreated waste and wastewater colored blue (i.e., a deodorizing agent in some aircraft toilets) are not disinfected and have the potential to be infectious. Take these steps to protect yourself: Avoid causing or creating a fine spray of untreated waste material. Do not vent aircraft vacuum waste tanks inside hangars if the aircraft\u2019s external venting system is not equipped with a filter to prevent the spread of germs from the waste. If you must vent the vacuum waste tanks inside a hangar, use a technique that exhausts the air outside the hangar. Use employer-provided PPE when handling human waste or sewage: Splash-proof face shield Liquid-repellent coveralls Waterproof gloves Rubber boots Remove PPE after use following your employers\u2019 instructions, and immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.

{"title": "Interim Guidance for Collection and Submission of Postmortem Specimens from Deceased Persons Under Investigation (PUI) for COVID-19", "time": "2020-4-2 00:00:00", "author": "", "link": "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-postmortem-specimens.html", "content": "Summary of Changes to the Guidance:This document is an update to interim guidance as of March 25, 2020 include: Recommended upper respiratory tract swab specimens are limited to nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens. Recognition that COVID-19 testing, authorized by the Food and Drug Administration under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), is becoming available in public health and clinical laboratories. Considerations for when collection and submission of postmortem specimens might be considered for both known and suspected COVID-19 cases.

On This Page Recommended Postmortem SpecimensRecommended Biosafety and Infection Control PracticesCollection of Postmortem Nasopharyngeal Swab (NP Swab) Specimens OnlySubmission of Specimens for TestingCleaning and Waste Disposal RecommendationsTransportation of Human RemainsAdditional Resources Medical examiners, coroners, and pathologists should immediately notify their localexternal icon or state external iconhealth department in the event of the identification of a deceased person with known or suspected COVID-19. State and local health departments who have identified a deceased known or suspected COVID-19 case can notify CDC\u2019s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at 770-488-7100 for urgent consultation if an autopsy is being considered or submission of autopsy tissue specimens or postmortem swabs to CDC for COVID-19 testing is desired. The EOC will assist local/state health departments to collect, store, and ship specimens appropriately to CDC, including during afterhours or on weekends/holidays. This interim guidance is based on what is currently known about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Current knowledge suggests that spread from a living person happens with close contact (i.e., within about 6 feet) via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, similar to how influenza and other respiratory pathogens spread. Recent studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19. This route of transmission is not a concern when handling human remains or performing postmortem procedures. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. CDC will update this interim guidance as additional information becomes available. This document provides specific guidance for the collection and submission of postmortem specimens from deceased known or suspected COVID-19 cases. This document also provides recommendations for biosafety and infection control practices during specimen collection and handling, including during autopsy procedures. The guidance can be utilized by medical examiners, coroners, pathologists, other workers involved in providing postmortem care, and local and state health departments. Postmortem activities should be conducted with a focus on avoiding aerosol generating procedures and ensuring that if aerosol generation is likely (e.g., when using an oscillating saw) that appropriate engineering controls and personal protective equipment (PPE) are used. These precautions and the use of Standard Precautions should ensure that appropriate work practices are used to prevent direct contact with infectious material, percutaneous injury, and hazards related to moving heavy remains and handling embalming chemicals. Medical examiners, coroners, and other healthcare professionals should use their judgment to determine if a decedent had signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19 during life and whether postmortem testing should be pursued. Most patients with confirmed COVID-19 have developed fever and/or symptoms of acute respiratory illness (e.g., cough, difficulty breathing). There are epidemiologic factors that may also help guide decisions about COVID-19 testing, such as documented COVID-19 infections in a jurisdiction, known community transmission, contact with a known COVID-19 case, or being a part of a cluster of respiratory illness in a closed setting (e.g., a long-term care facility). Testing for other causes of respiratory illness (e.g., influenza) is strongly encouraged. Recommended Postmortem Specimens Recommendations about the type of postmortem specimens to collect\u00a0vary based on whether the case of COVID-19 is suspected or confirmed, as well as whether an autopsy is performed. The following factors should be considered when determining if an autopsy will be performed for a deceased known or suspected COVID-19 case: medicolegal jurisdiction, facility environmental controls, availability of recommended personal protective equipment (PPE), and family and cultural wishes. If an autopsy is performed for a suspected COVID-19 case, collection of the following postmortem specimens is recommended: Postmortem swab specimens for COVID-19 testing: Upper respiratory tract swab: Nasopharyngeal Swab (NP swab) Lower respiratory tract swab: Lung swab from each lung Separate swab specimens for testing of other respiratory pathogens and other postmortem testing, as indicated Formalin-fixed autopsy tissues from lung, upper airway, and other major organs If an autopsy is NOT performed for a suspected COVID-19 case, collection of the following postmortem specimens is recommended: Postmortem Nasopharyngeal Swab (NP swab) specimen for COVID-19 testing Separate NP swab for testing of other respiratory pathogens If an autopsy is performed for a confirmed COVID-19 case, collection of the following postmortem specimens should be considered: Postmortem swab specimens for testing of other respiratory pathogens, Other postmortem microbiologic and infectious disease testing, as indicated Formalin-fixed autopsy tissues from lung, upper airway, and other major organs In addition to postmortem specimens, any remaining specimens (e.g., NP swab, sputum, serum, stool) that may have been collected prior to death should be retained. Please refer to Interim Guidelines for Collecting, Handling, and Testing Clinical Specimens from Persons for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) for more information. Recommended Biosafety and Infection Control Practices Collection of Postmortem Nasopharyngeal Swab (NP Swab) Specimens Only Instructions in this section apply if only postmortem NP swabs are being collected from a deceased person with known or suspected COVID-19. If an autopsy is being performed or aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) are being conducted, instructions in the section Autopsy Procedures should be followed. If only a postmortem NP swab is being collected, individuals in the room during specimen collection should be limited to healthcare personnel (HCP) obtaining the specimen. HCP should follow Standard Precautions. Engineering Control Recommendations for NP Swab Collection: Since collection of nasopharyngeal swab specimens from deceased persons will not induce coughing or sneezing, a negative pressure room is not required if only a NP swab is being collected from the decedent. Personnel should adhere to Standard Precautions as described above. PPE Recommendations for NP Swab Collection: Since collection of nasopharyngeal swab specimens from deceased persons will not induce coughing or sneezing, NIOSH-certified disposable N-95 respirator or higher is not required if only a NP swab is being collected from the decedent. The following PPE should be worn at a minimum: Wear nonsterile, nitrile gloves when handling potentially infectious materials. If there is a risk of cuts, puncture wounds, or other injuries that break the skin, wear heavy-duty gloves over the nitrile gloves. Wear a clean, long-sleeved fluid-resistant or impermeable gown to protect skin and clothing. Use a plastic face shield or a face mask and goggles to protect the face, eyes, nose, and mouth from splashes of potentially infectious bodily fluids. Autopsy Procedures Standard Precautions, Contact Precautions, and Airborne Precautions with eye protection (goggles or a face shield) should be followed during autopsy. Many of the following procedures are consistent with existing guidelines for safe work practices in the autopsy setting; see Guidelines for Safe Work Practices in Human and Animal Medical Diagnostic Laboratories. AGPs such as use of an oscillating bone saw should be avoided for known or suspected COVID-19 cases. Consider using hand shears as an alternative cutting tool. If an oscillating saw is used, attach a vacuum shroud to contain aerosols. Allow only one person to cut at a given time. Limit the number of personnel working in the autopsy suite at any given time to the minimum number of people necessary to safely conduct the autopsy. Limit the number of personnel working on the human body at any given time. Use a biosafety cabinet for the handling and examination of smaller specimens and other containment equipment whenever possible. Use caution when handling needles or other sharps, and dispose of contaminated sharps in puncture-proof, labeled, closable sharps containers. A logbook including names, dates, and activities of all workers participating in the postmortem and cleaning of the autopsy suite should be kept to assist in future follow up, if necessary. Include custodian staff entering after hours or during the day. Engineering Control Recommendations for Autopsies: Autopsies on known or suspected COVID-19 cases should be conducted in Airborne Infection Isolation Rooms (AIIRs). These rooms are at negative pressure to surrounding areas, have a minimum of 6 air changes per hour (ACH) for existing structures and 12 ACH for renovated or new structures, and have air exhausted directly outside or through a HEPA filter. Doors to the room should be kept closed except during entry and egress. If an AIIR is not available, ensure the room is negative pressure with no air recirculation to adjacent spaces. A portable HEPA recirculation unit could be placed in the room to provide further reduction in aerosols. Local airflow control (i.e., laminar flow systems) can be used to direct aerosols away from personnel. If use of an AIIR or HEPA unit is not possible, the procedure should be performed in the most protective environment possible. Air should never be returned to the building interior, but should be exhausted outdoors, away from areas of human traffic or gathering spaces and away from other air intake systems. PPE Recommendations for Autopsies: The following PPE should be worn during autopsy procedures: Double surgical gloves interposed with a layer of cut-proof synthetic mesh gloves Fluid-resistant or impermeable gown Waterproof apron Goggles or face shield NIOSH-certified disposable N-95 respirator or higher Powered, air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) with HEPA filters may provide increased worker comfort during extended autopsy procedures. When respirators are necessary to protect workers, employers must implement a comprehensive respiratory protection program in accordance with the OSHA Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134external icon) that includes medical exams, fit-testing, and training. Surgical scrubs, shoe covers, and surgical cap should be used per routine protocols. Doff (take off) PPEpdf icon carefully to avoid contaminating yourself and before leaving the autopsy suite or adjacent anteroom. After removing PPE, discard the PPE in the appropriate laundry or waste receptacle. Reusable PPE (e.g., goggles, face shields, and PAPRs) must be cleaned and disinfected according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations before reuse. Immediately after doffing PPE, wash hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. If hands are not visibly dirty and soap and water are not available, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60%-95% alcohol may be used. However, if hands are visibly dirty, always wash hands with soap and water before using alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Avoid touching the face with gloved or unwashed hands. Ensure that hand hygiene facilities are readily available at the point of use (e.g., at or adjacent to the PPE doffing area). If the PPE supply is low, see Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of PPE. Additional safety and health guidance is available for workers handling deceased known or suspected COVID-19 cases at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), COVID-19 websiteexternal icon. Collection of Postmortem Specimens Implementing proper biosafety and infection control practices is critical when collecting specimens. Please refer to Interim Laboratory Biosafety Guidelines for Handling and Processing Specimens Associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\u00a0for additional information. Collection of Postmortem Swab Specimens for COVID-19 Testing For suspected COVID-19 cases, CDC recommends collecting and testing postmortem nasopharyngeal swabs (NP swabs) and if an autopsy is performed, lower respiratory specimens (lung swabs). If the diagnosis of COVID-19 was established before death, collection of these specimens for COVID-19 testing may not be necessary. Medical examiners, coroners, and pathologists should work with their local or state health department to determine capacity for testing postmortem swab specimens. Use only synthetic fiber swabs with plastic shafts. Do not use calcium alginate swabs or swabs with wooden shafts, as they may contain substances that inactivate some viruses and inhibit PCR testing. Place swabs immediately into sterile tubes containing 2-3 ml of viral transport media. NP and lung swab specimens should be kept in separate vials. Refrigerate specimen at 2-8\u00b0C and ship overnight to CDC on ice pack. Upper Respiratory Tract Specimen Collection: Nasopharyngeal Swab (NP swab) Insert a swab into the nostril parallel to the palate. Leave the swab in place for a few seconds to absorb secretions. Swab both nasopharyngeal areas with the same swab. Lower respiratory tract Specimen Collection: Lung swabs Collect one swab from each lung (left and right). Options for lung swab collection include the following, and may depend on the institution\u2019s standard practices or type of autopsy procedure (e.g., full or in-situ autopsy) During the internal exam, after the heart-lung block is removed, insert one swab as far down into the tracheobronchial tree as possible on either side (left and right) First wipe the surface of each lung with an iodine-containing disinfectant clean and dry the surface; then use a sterile scalpel to cut a slit of the lung and insert the swab to collect sample on either side. Storage of Postmortem Swab Specimens Store specimens at 2-8\u00b0C for up to 72 hours after collection.\u00a0If a delay in testing or shipping is expected, store specimens at -70\u00b0C or below. Collection of Postmortem Specimens for Other Routine Testing Separate postmortem specimens (e.g., NP or lung swabs) should be collected for routine testing of respiratory pathogens at either clinical or public health labs. Note that clinical laboratories should NOT attempt viral isolation from specimens collected from known or suspected COVID-19 cases. Other postmortem specimen collection and evaluations should be directed by the decedent\u2019s clinical and exposure history, scene investigation, and gross autopsy findings, and may include routine bacterial cultures, toxicology, and other studies as indicated. Collection of Fixed Autopsy Tissue Specimens The preferred specimens would be a minimum of eight blocks and fixed tissue specimens representing samples from the respiratory sites listed below in addition to specimens from major organs (including liver, spleen, kidney, heart, GI tract) and any other tissues showing significant gross pathology. The recommended respiratory sites include: Trachea (proximal and distal) Central (hilar) lung with segmental bronchi, right and left primary bronchi Representative pulmonary parenchyma from right and left lung Viral antigens and nucleic acid may be focal or sparsely distributed in patients with respiratory viral infections and are most frequently detected in respiratory epithelium of large airways. For example, larger airways (particularly primary and segmental bronchi) have the highest yield for detection of respiratory viruses by molecular testing and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. Performance of specific immunohistochemical, molecular, or other assays will be determined using clinical and epidemiologic information provided by the submitter and the histopathologic features identified in the submitted tissue specimens. Collection of tissue samples roughly 4-5 mm in thickness (i.e., sample would fit in a tissue cassette) is recommended for optimal fixation. The volume of formalin used to fix tissues should be 10x the volume of tissue. Place tissue in 10% buffered formalin for three days (72 hours) for optimal fixation. Safely Preparing the Specimens for Shipment After collecting and properly securing and labeling specimens in primary containers with the appropriate media/solution, they must be transferred from the autopsy suite in a safe manner to laboratory staff who can process them for shipping. Within the autopsy suite, primary containers should be placed into a larger secondary container. If possible, the secondary container should then be placed into a resealable plastic bag that was not in the autopsy suite when the specimens were collected. The resealable plastic bag should then be placed into a biological specimen bag with absorbent material; and then can be transferred outside of the autopsy suite. Workers receiving the biological specimen bag outside the autopsy suite or anteroom should wear disposable nitrile gloves. Submission of Specimens for Testing Submission of Postmortem Swab Specimens for COVID-19 Testing Medical examiners, coroners, and other healthcare professionals should work with their state and local health departments to coordinate testing through public health laboratories. In addition, COVID-19 testing, authorized by the Food and Drug Administration under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), is becoming available in clinical laboratories. State and local health departments can contact CDC\u2019s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at 770-488-7100 for assistance with obtaining, storing, and shipping appropriate specimens to CDC for testing, including after hours or on weekends or holidays, if testing of postmortem swab specimens is not available in their public health laboratory. This section applies to submission of postmortem NP swab and lung swabs Store specimens at 2-8\u00b0C for up to 72 hours after collection and ship overnight to CDC on ice pack.\u00a0If a delay in testing or shipping is expected, store specimens at -70\u00b0C or below and ship overnight to CDC on dry ice. Label each specimen container with the patient\u2019s ID number (e.g., medical record number), unique specimen ID (e.g., laboratory requisition number), specimen type (e.g., serum) and the date the sample was collected. Complete a CDC Form 50.34\u00a0for each specimen submitted. In the upper left box of the form provide the following: (1) for test requested select \u201cRespiratory virus molecular detection (non-influenza) CDC-10401\u201d and (2) for At CDC, bring to the attention of enter \u201cStephen Lindstrom: COVID-19 PUI \u2013 Autopsy specimens\u201d. Postmortem swab specimens from known or suspected COVID-19 cases must be packaged, shipped, and transported according to the current edition of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) Dangerous Goods Regulationsexternal icon. Additional useful and detailed information on packing, shipping, and transporting specimens can be found at Interim Laboratory Biosafety Guidelines for Handling and Processing Specimens Associated with Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Submission of Fixed Autopsy Tissue Specimens CDC\u2019s Infectious Diseases Pathology Branch (IDPB) can receive fixed autopsy tissue specimens from known or suspected COVID-19 cases. IDPB will perform histopathologic evaluation; testing for COVID-19, as well as other respiratory viral pathogens (e.g., influenza); and bacterial and other infections, as indicated. Paraffin-embedded tissue blocks In general, this is the preferred specimen and is especially important to submit in cases where tissues have been in formalin for a significant time. Prolonged fixation (>2 weeks) may interfere with some immunohistochemical and molecular diagnostic assays. Wet tissue If available, we highly recommend that unprocessed tissues in 10% neutral buffered formalin be submitted in addition to paraffin blocks. Requirements for submitting fixed tissues to CDC Contact CDC\u2019s Infectious Diseases Pathology Branch at pathology@cdc.gov who will provide a pre-populated CDC Form 50.34 for your convenience.

Current evidence suggests that novel coronavirus may remain viable for hours to days on surfaces made from a variety of materials. Routine cleaning and disinfection procedures (e.g., using cleaners and water to pre-clean surfaces prior to applying Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved disinfectant products with emerging viral pathogens claimsexternal icon\u00a0that\u00a0are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses in these settings. After an autopsy of a decedent with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, the following recommendations apply for the autopsy room (and anteroom if applicable): Keep ventilation systems active while cleaning is conducted; before cleaning, wait 24 hours in a non-healthcare setting, or if you know the air changes per hour of the room or area in a healthcare setting, follow the recommended wait time\u00a0before cleaning. Wear disposable gloves recommended by the manufacturer of the cleaner or disinfectant while cleaning and when handling cleaning or disinfecting solutions. Dispose of gloves if they become damaged or soiled and when cleaning is completed, as described below. Never wash or reuse gloves. Use eye protection, such as a faceshield or goggles, if splashing of water, cleaner/disinfectant, or other fluids, is expected. Wear a clean, long-sleeved fluid-resistant gown to protect skin and clothing. Wear a NIOSH-certified disposable N-95 respirator or higher if you need to clean the room or area in less than 24 hours or the appropriate wait time as defined in the table above cannot be met. Additional PPE may be required to protect workers against potential hazards associated with the cleaning and disinfectant products used and in accordance with the label instructions. If PPE is in low supply, consider having workers who performed autopsies conduct the cleaning and sanitizing of the area. When respirators are necessary to protect workers, employers must implement a comprehensive respiratory protection program in accordance with the OSHA Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134external icon) that includes medical exams, fit-testing, and training. Ensure workers are trained on OSHA\u2019s Hazard Communication standard, 29 CFR 1910.1200external icon, to communicate with workers about the hazardous chemicals used in the workplace. Use disinfectant products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimsexternal icon\u00a0that\u00a0are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time, etc.). Clean the surface first, and then apply the disinfectant as instructed on the disinfectant manufacturer\u2019s label. Ensure adequate contact time for effective disinfection. Adhere to any safety precautions or other label recommendations as directed (e.g., allowing adequate ventilation in confined areas and proper disposal of unused product or used containers). Avoid using product application methods that cause splashing or generate aerosols. Cleaning activities should be supervised and inspected periodically to ensure correct procedures are followed. Do not use compressed air and/or water under pressure for cleaning, or any other methods that can cause splashing or might re-aerosolize infectious material. Gross contamination and liquids should be collected with absorbent materials, such as towels, by staff conducting the autopsy wearing designated PPE. Gross contamination and liquids should then be disposed of as described below: Use of tongs and other utensils can minimize the need for personal contact with soiled absorbent materials. Large areas contaminated with body fluids should be treated with disinfectant following removal of the fluid with absorbent material. The area should then be cleaned and given a final disinfection. Small amounts of liquid waste (e.g., body fluids) can be flushed or washed down ordinary sanitary drains without special procedures. Hard, nonporous surfaces may then be cleaned and disinfected as described above. Follow standard operating procedures for the containment and disposal of used PPE and regulated medical waste. State and local governments should be consulted for appropriate disposal decisions. Dispose of human tissues according to routine procedures for pathological waste. Clean and disinfect or autoclave non-disposable instruments using routine procedures, taking appropriate precautions with sharp objects. Materials or clothing that will be laundered can be removed from the autopsy suite (or anteroom, if applicable) in a sturdy, leak-proof biohazard bag that is tied shut and not reopened. These materials should then be sent for laundering according to routine procedures. Wash reusable, non-launderable items (e.g., aprons) with detergent solution on the warmest setting possible, rinse with water, decontaminate using disinfectant, and allow items to dry completely before next use. Keep camera, telephones, computer keyboards, and other items that remain in the autopsy suite (or anteroom, if applicable) as clean as possible, but treat as if they are contaminated and handle with gloves. Wipe the items after use with appropriate Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved disinfectant products with emerging viral pathogens claimsexternal icon\u00a0that are expected to be effective against COVID-19. If being removed from the autopsy suite, ensure complete decontamination with appropriate disinfectant according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations prior to removal and reuse. When cleaning is complete and PPE has been removed, wash hands immediately with soap and water for 20 seconds. If hands are not visibly dirty and soap and water are not available, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60%-95% alcohol may be used. However, if hands are visibly dirty, always wash hands with soap and water before using alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Avoid touching the face with gloved or unwashed hands. Ensure that hand hygiene facilities are readily available at the point of use (e.g., at or adjacent to the PPE doffing area). Transportation of Human Remains Follow standard routine procedures when transporting the body after specimens have been collected and the body has been bagged. Disinfect the outside of the bag with a product with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimsexternal icon\u00a0expected to be effective against COVID-19 applied according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. Wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling the body bag.

Risk of Severe Illness from COVID-19 People with moderate to severe asthma may be at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19.\u00a0 COVID-19 can affect your respiratory tract (nose, throat, lungs), cause an asthma attack, and possibly lead to pneumonia and acute respiratory disease. Treatment There is currently no specific treatment for or vaccine to prevent COVID-19.\u00a0 The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. Prepare for COVID-19 Stock up on supplies. Take everyday precautions\u00a0to keep space between yourself and others. When you go out in public, keep away from others who are sick. Clean your hands often by washing with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Avoid crowds and people who are sick. Avoid cruise travel\u00a0and non-essential air travel. During a COVID-19 outbreak in your community, stay home\u00a0as much as possible to further reduce your risk of being exposed. If someone in your home is sick, have them stay away from the rest of the household to reduce the risk of spreading the virus in your home. Avoid sharing personal household items such as cups and towels. Follow your Asthma Action Plan Keep your asthma under control by following your asthma action plan. Continue your current medications, including any inhalers with steroids in them (\u201csteroids\u201d is another word for corticosteroids). Don\u2019t stop any medications or change your asthma treatment plan without talking to your healthcare provider. Discuss any concerns about your treatment with your healthcare provider. Talk to your healthcare provider, insurer, and pharmacist about creating an emergency supply of prescription medications, such as asthma inhalers. Make sure that you have 30 days of non-prescription medications and supplies\u00a0on hand too in case you need to stay home for a long time. Know how to use your inhaler. Avoid your\u00a0asthma triggers. As more cases of COVID-19 are discovered and our communities take action to combat the spread of disease, it is natural for some people to feel concerned or stressed. Strong emotions can trigger an asthma attack.\u00a0Take steps to help yourself cope with stress and anxiety. Clean and disinfect things you or your family touch frequently If possible, have someone who doesn\u2019t have asthma do the cleaning and disinfecting. When they use cleaning and disinfecting products, have them: Make sure that people with asthma are not in the room. Minimize use of disinfectants that can cause an asthma attack. Open windows or doors and use a fan that blows air outdoors. Clean and disinfect surfaces like phones, remotes, tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks daily. Always follow the instructions on the product label. Spray or pour spray products onto a cleaning cloth or paper towel instead of spraying the product directly onto the cleaning surface (if the product label allows). If you have symptoms Contact your health care provider to ask about your symptoms."}

Based on what is currently known about COVID-19, spread from person-to-person of this virus happens most frequently among close contacts (within about 6 feet). This type of transmission occurs via respiratory droplets. On the other hand, transmission of novel coronavirus to persons from surfaces contaminated with the virus has not been documented. Recent studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19. Transmission of coronavirus occurs much more commonly through respiratory droplets than through fomites. Current evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may remain viable for hours to days on surfaces made from a variety of materials. Cleaning of visibly dirty surfaces followed by disinfection is a best practice measure for prevention of COVID-19 and other viral respiratory illnesses in households and community settings. It is unknown how long the air inside a room occupied by someone with confirmed COVID-19 remains potentially infectious. Facilities will need to consider factors such as the size of the room and the ventilation system design (including flowrate [air changes per hour] and location of supply and exhaust vents) when deciding how long to close off rooms or areas used by ill persons before beginning disinfection. \u00a0Taking measures to improve ventilation in an area or room where someone was ill or suspected to be ill with COVID-19 will help shorten the time it takes respiratory droplets to be removed from the air. PurposeThis guidance provides recommendations on the cleaning and disinfection of households where persons under investigation (PUI)\u00a0or those with confirmed COVID-19 reside or may be in self- isolation. It is aimed at limiting the survival of the virus in the environments. These recommendations will be updated if additional information becomes available. These guidelines are focused on household settings and are meant for the general public. Cleaning refers to the removal of germs, dirt, and impurities from surfaces. It does not kill germs, but by removing them, it lowers their numbers and the risk of spreading infection. Disinfecting refers to using chemicals, for example, EPA-registered disinfectants, to kill germs on surfaces. This process does not necessarily clean dirty surfaces or remove germs, but by killing germs on a surface after cleaning, it can further lower the risk of spreading infection. General Recommendations for Routine Cleaning and Disinfection of Households Community members can practice routine cleaning of frequently touched surfaces (for example: tables, doorknobs, light switches, handles, desks, toilets, faucets, sinks, and electronics (see below for special electronics cleaning and disinfection instructions)) with household cleaners and EPA-registered disinfectantsexternal icon that are appropriate for the surface, following label instructions. Labels contain instructions for safe and effective use of the cleaning product including precautions you should take when applying the product, such as wearing gloves and making sure you have good ventilation during use of the product. For electronics follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products. Consider use of wipeable covers for electronics. If no manufacturer guidance is available, consider the use of alcohol-based wipes or spray containing at least 70% alcohol to disinfect touch screens. Dry surfaces thoroughly to avoid pooling of liquids. General Recommendations for Cleaning and Disinfection of Households with People Isolated in Home Care (e.g. Suspected/Confirmed to have COVID-19) Household members should educate themselves about COVID-19 symptoms and preventing the spread of COVID-19 in homes. Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces daily in household common areas (e.g. tables, hard-backed chairs, doorknobs, light switches, phones, tablets, touch screens, remote controls, keyboards, handles, desks, toilets, sinks) In the bedroom/bathroom dedicated for an ill person: consider reducing cleaning frequency to as-needed (e.g., soiled items and surfaces) to avoid unnecessary contact with the ill person. As much as possible, an ill person should stay in a specific room and away from other people in their home, following home care guidance. The caregiver can provide personal cleaning supplies for an ill person\u2019s room and bathroom, unless the room is occupied by child or another person for whom such supplies would not be appropriate. These supplies include tissues, paper towels, cleaners and EPA-registered disinfectants (see examplesexternal icon). If a separate bathroom is not available, the bathroom should be cleaned and disinfected after each use by an ill person. If this is not possible, the caregiver should wait as long as practical after use by an ill person to clean and disinfect the high-touch surfaces. Household members should follow home care guidance\u00a0when interacting with persons with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 and their isolation rooms/bathrooms. How to clean and disinfect:Hard (Non-porous) Surfaces Wear disposable gloves when cleaning and disinfecting surfaces. Gloves should be discarded after each cleaning. If reusable gloves are used, those gloves should be dedicated for cleaning and disinfection of surfaces for COVID-19 and should not be used for other purposes. Consult the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for cleaning and disinfection products used. Clean hands immediately after gloves are removed. If surfaces are dirty, they should be cleaned using a detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection. For disinfection, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants should be effective. A list of products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19 is available herepdf iconexternal icon. Follow manufacturer\u2019s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products for (concentration, application method and contact time, etc.). Additionally, diluted household bleach solutions (at least 1000ppm sodium hypochlorite) can be used if appropriate for the surface. Follow manufacturer\u2019s instructions for application, ensuring a contact time of at least 1 minute, and allowing proper ventilation during and after application. Check to ensure the product is not past its expiration date. Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser. Unexpired household bleach will be effective against coronaviruses when properly diluted. Prepare a bleach solution by mixing: 5 tablespoons (1/3rd cup) bleach per gallon of water or 4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water Soft (Porous) Surfaces For soft (porous) surfaces such as carpeted floor, rugs, and drapes, remove visible contamination if present and clean with appropriate cleaners indicated for use on these surfaces. After cleaning: Launder items as appropriate in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. If possible, launder items using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely. Otherwise, use products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19pdf iconexternal icon and that are suitable for porous surfaces. Electronics For electronics such as cell phones, tablets, touch screens, remote controls, and keyboards, remove visible contamination if present. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products. Consider use of wipeable covers for electronics. If no manufacturer guidance is available, consider the use of alcohol-based wipes or sprays containing at least 70% alcohol to disinfect touch screens. Dry surfaces thoroughly to avoid pooling of liquids. Linens, clothing, and other items that go in the laundry Wear disposable gloves when handling dirty laundry from an ill person and then discard after each use. If using reusable gloves, those gloves should be dedicated for cleaning and disinfection of surfaces for COVID-19 and should not be used for other household purposes. Clean hands immediately after gloves are removed. If no gloves are used when handling dirty laundry, be sure to wash hands afterwards. If possible, do not shake dirty laundry. This will minimize the possibility of dispersing virus through the air. Launder items as appropriate in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. If possible, launder items using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely. Dirty laundry from an ill person can be washed with other people\u2019s items. Clean and disinfect clothes hampers according to guidance above for surfaces. If possible, consider placing a bag liner that is either disposable (can be thrown away) or can be laundered. Hand hygiene and other preventive measures Household members should clean hands often, including immediately after removing gloves and after contact with an ill person, by washing hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available and hands are not visibly dirty, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol may be used. However, if hands are visibly dirty, always wash hands with soap and water. Household members should follow normal preventive actions while at work and home including recommended hand hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands. Additional key times to clean hands include: After blowing one\u2019s nose, coughing, or sneezing After using the restroom Before eating or preparing food After contact with animals or pets Before and after providing routine care for another person who needs assistance (e.g. a child) Other considerations The ill person should eat/be fed in their room if possible. Non-disposable food service items used should be handled with gloves and washed with hot water or in a dishwasher. Clean hands after handling used food service items. If possible, dedicate a lined trash can for the ill person. Use gloves when removing garbage bags, handling, and disposing of trash. Wash hands after handling or disposing of trash. Consider consulting with your local health department about trash disposal guidance if available."}

The outbreak first started in China, but cases have been identified in a growing number of other areas, including the United States. Patients with COVID-19 have had mild to severe respiratory illness. Data suggests that symptoms may appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 days after exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19. Symptoms can include fever, cough, difficulty breathing, and shortness of breath. The virus causing COVID-19 is called SARS-CoV-2. It is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person via respiratory droplets among close contacts. Respiratory droplets are produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks and can land in the mouths or noses, or possibly be inhaled into the lungs, of people who are nearby. Close contact may include: Being within approximately 6 feet of an individual with COVID-19 for a prolonged period of time. Having direct contact with body fluids (such as blood, phlegm, and respiratory droplets) from an individual with COVID-19. Recent studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19. To protect yourself from exposure If possible, maintain a distance of at least 6 feet. Practice proper hand hygiene. Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available and illicit drugs are NOT suspected to be present, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Do not touch your face with unwashed hands. Have a trained Emergency Medical Service/ Emergency Medical Technician (EMS/EMT) assess and transport anyone you think might have COVID-19 to a healthcare facility. Ensure only trained personnel wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) have contact with individuals who have or may have COVID-19. Learn your employer\u2019s plan for exposure control and participate in all-hands training on the use of PPE for respiratory protection, if available. Recommended Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)Law enforcement who must make contact with individuals confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19 should follow CDC\u2019s Interim Guidance for EMS. Different styles of PPE may be necessary to perform operational duties. These alternative styles (i.e. coveralls) must provide protection that is at least as great as that provided by the minimum amount of PPE recommended. The minimum PPE recommended is: A single pair of disposable examination gloves, Disposable isolation gown or single-use/disposable coveralls*, Any NIOSH-approved particulate respirator (i.e., N-95 or higher-level respirator); Facemasks are an acceptable alternative until the supply chain is restored, and Eye protection (i.e., goggles or disposable face shield that fully covers the front and sides of the face) *If unable to wear a disposable gown or coveralls because it limits access to duty belt and gear, ensure duty belt and gear are disinfected after contact with individual. If close contact occurred during apprehension Clean and disinfect duty belt and gear prior to reuse using a household cleaning spray or wipe, according to the product label. Follow standard operating procedures for the containment and disposal of used PPE. Follow standard operating procedures for containing and laundering clothes. Avoid shaking the clothes. For law enforcement personnel performing daily routine activities, the immediate health risk is considered low. Law enforcement leadership and personnel should follow CDC\u2019s Interim General Business Guidance."}

Based on what is currently known about the virus and about similar coronaviruses that cause SARS and MERS, spread from person-to-person happens most frequently among close contacts (within about 6 feet). This type of transmission occurs via respiratory droplets, but disease transmission via infectious aerosols is currently uncertain. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to persons from surfaces contaminated with the virus has not been documented. Transmission of coronavirus in general occurs much more commonly through respiratory droplets than through fomites. Current evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may remain viable for hours to days on surfaces made from a variety of materials. Cleaning of visibly dirty surfaces followed by disinfection is a best practice measure for prevention of COVID-19 and other viral respiratory illnesses in community settings. It is unknown how long the air inside a room occupied by someone with confirmed COVID-19 remains potentially infectious. Facilities will need to consider factors such as the size of the room and the ventilation system design (including flowrate [air changes per hour] and location of supply and exhaust vents) when deciding how long to close off rooms or areas used by ill persons before beginning disinfection. Taking measures to improve ventilation in an area or room where someone was ill or suspected to be ill with COVID-19 will help shorten the time it takes respiratory droplets to be removed from the air. PurposeThis guidance provides recommendations on the cleaning and disinfection of rooms or areas occupied by those with suspected or with confirmed COVID-19. It is aimed at limiting the survival of SARS-CoV-2 in key environments. These recommendations will be updated if additional information becomes available. These guidelines are focused on community, non-healthcare facilities such as schools, institutions of higher education, offices, daycare centers, businesses, and community centers that do, and do not, house persons overnight. These guidelines are not meant\u00a0 for cleaning staff in healthcare facilities or repatriation sites, households, or for others for whom specific guidance already exists. Definitions Community facilities such as schools, daycare centers, and businesses comprise most non-healthcare settings that are visited by the general public outside of a household. Cleaning refers to the removal of dirt and impurities, including germs, from surfaces. Cleaning alone does not kill germs. But by removing the germs, it decreases their number and therefore any risk of spreading infection. Disinfecting works by using chemicals, for example EPA-registered disinfectants, to kill germs on surfaces. This process does not necessarily clean dirty surfaces or remove germs. But killing germs remaining on a surface after cleaning further reduces any risk of spreading infection. Cleaning and Disinfection After Persons Suspected/Confirmed to Have COVID-19 Have Been in the FacilityTiming and location of cleaning and disinfection of surfaces At a school, daycare center, office, or other facility that does not house people overnight: Close off areas visited by the ill persons. Open outside doors and windows and use ventilating fans to increase air circulation in the area. Wait 24 hours or as long as practical before beginning cleaning and disinfection. Cleaning staff should clean and disinfect all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment (like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines) used by the ill persons, focusing especially on frequently touched surfaces. At a facility that does house people overnight: Follow Interim Guidance for US Institutions of Higher Education\u00a0on working with state and local health officials to isolate ill persons and provide temporary housing as needed. Close off areas visited by the ill persons. Open outside doors and windows and use ventilating fans to increase air circulation in the area. Wait 24 hours or as long as practical before beginning cleaning and disinfection. In areas where ill persons are being housed in isolation, follow Interim Guidance for Environmental Cleaning and Disinfection for U.S. Households with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019. This includes focusing on cleaning and disinfecting common areas where staff/others providing services may come into contact with ill persons but reducing cleaning and disinfection of bedrooms/bathrooms used by ill persons to as-needed. In areas where ill persons have visited or used, continue routine cleaning and disinfection as in this guidance. If it has been more than 7 days since the person with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 visited or used the facility, additional cleaning and disinfection is not necessary. How to Clean and DisinfectHard (Non-porous) Surfaces If surfaces are dirty, they should be cleaned using a detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection. For disinfection, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants should be effective. A list of products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19 is available herepdf iconexternal icon. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products for concentration, application method and contact time, etc. Additionally, diluted household bleach solutions (at least 1000ppm sodium hypochlorite) can be used if appropriate for the surface. Follow manufacturer\u2019s instructions for application, ensuring a contact time of at least 1 minute, and allowing proper ventilation during and after application. Check to ensure the product is not past its expiration date. Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser. Unexpired household bleach will be effective against coronaviruses when properly diluted. Prepare a bleach solution by mixing: 5 tablespoons (1/3 cup) bleach per gallon of water or 4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water Soft (Porous) Surfaces For soft (porous) surfaces such as carpeted floor, rugs, and drapes, remove visible contamination if present and clean with appropriate cleaners indicated for use on these surfaces. After cleaning: If the items can be laundered, launder items in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and then dry items completely. Otherwise, use products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19pdf iconexternal icon and that are suitable for porous surfaces Electronics For electronics such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines, remove visible contamination if present. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products. Consider use of wipeable covers for electronics. If no manufacturer guidance is available, consider the use of alcohol-based wipes or sprays containing at least 70% alcohol to disinfect touch screens. Dry surfaces thoroughly to avoid pooling of liquids. Linens, Clothing, and Other Items That Go in the Laundry In order to minimize the possibility of dispersing virus through the air, do not shake dirty laundry. Wash items as appropriate in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. If possible, launder items using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely. Dirty laundry that has been in contact with an ill person can be washed with other people\u2019s items. Clean and disinfect hampers or other carts for transporting laundry according to guidance above for hard or soft surfaces. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and Hand Hygiene The risk of exposure to cleaning staff is inherently low. Cleaning staff should wear disposable gloves and gowns for all tasks in the cleaning process, including handling trash. Gloves and gowns should be compatible with the disinfectant products being used. Additional PPE might be required based on the cleaning/disinfectant products being used and whether there is a risk of splash. Gloves and gowns should be removed carefully to avoid contamination of the wearer and the surrounding area. Be sure to clean hands after removing gloves. If gowns are not available, coveralls, aprons or work uniforms can be worn during cleaning and disinfecting. Reusable (washable) clothing should be laundered afterwards. Clean hands after handling dirty laundry. Gloves should be removed after cleaning a room or area occupied by ill persons. Clean hands immediately after gloves are removed. Cleaning staff should immediately report breaches in PPE such as a tear in gloves or any other potential exposures to their supervisor. Cleaning staff and others should clean hands often, including immediately after removing gloves and after contact with an ill person, by washing hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available and hands are not visibly dirty, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol may be used. However, if hands are visibly dirty, always wash hands with soap and water. Follow normal preventive actions while at work and home, including cleaning hands and avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands. Additional key times to clean hands include: After blowing one\u2019s nose, coughing, or sneezing. After using the restroom. Before eating or preparing food. After contact with animals or pets. Before and after providing routine care for another person who needs assistance such as a child. Additional Considerations for Employers Employers should work with their local and state health departments to ensure appropriate local protocols and guidelines, such as updated/additional guidance for cleaning and disinfection, are followed, including for identification of new potential cases of COVID-19. Employers should educate staff and workers performing cleaning, laundry, and trash pick-up activities to recognize the symptoms of COVID-19 and provide instructions on what to do if they develop symptoms\u00a0within 14 days after their last possible exposure to the virus. At a minimum, any staff should immediately notify their supervisor and the local health department if they develop symptoms of COVID-19. The health department will provide guidance on what actions need to be taken. Employers should develop policies for worker protection and provide training to all cleaning staff on site prior to providing cleaning tasks. Training should include when to use PPE, what PPE is necessary, how to properly don (put on), use, and doff (take off) PPE, and how to properly dispose of PPE. Employers must ensure workers are trained on the hazards of the cleaning chemicals used in the workplace in accordance with OSHA\u2019s Hazard Communication standard (29 CFR 1910.1200external icon). Employers must comply with OSHA\u2019s standards on Bloodborne Pathogens (29 CFR 1910.1030external icon), including proper disposal of regulated waste, and PPE (29 CFR 1910.132external icon)."}

Note that fever may be intermittent or may not be present in some people, such as those who are elderly, immunosuppressed, or taking certain medications (e.g., NSAIDs). ** Data are limited to define of close contact. Factors to consider when defining close contact include proximity, the duration of exposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk), whether the individual has symptoms (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure risk) and whether the individual was wearing a facemask (which can efficiently block respiratory secretions from contaminating others and the environment). ***Data are insufficient to precisely define the duration of time that constitutes a prolonged exposure. Recommendations vary on the length of time of exposure from 10 minutes or more to 30 minutes or more. In healthcare settings, it is reasonable to define a prolonged exposure as any exposure greater than a few minutes because the contact is someone who is ill. Brief interactions are less likely to result in transmission; however, symptoms and the type of interaction (e.g., did the person cough directly into the face of the individual) remain important.

Public health emergencies, such as the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), are stressful times for people and communities. Fear and anxiety about a disease can lead to social stigma(1)\u00a0toward people, places, or things. For example, stigma and discrimination can occur when people associate a disease, such as COVID-19, with a population or nationality, even though not everyone in that population or from that region is specifically at risk for the disease. Stigma can also occur after a person has been released from COVID-19 quarantine even though they are not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others. Some groups of people who may be experiencing stigma because of COVID-19 include: Persons of Asian descent People who have traveled Emergency responders or healthcare professionals Stigma hurts everyone by creating fear or anger towards other people.

In line with our recommendations for other essential critical infrastructure workers, this guidance does not apply to critical transportation and delivery workers who are desperately needed for New York residents to continue their daily lives and respond to the COVID-19 outbreak. Truck drivers and other people driving into the city to deliver needed supplies should stay in their vehicles as much as possible as supplies are loaded and unloaded, avoid being within 6 feet of others as much as possible when they exit their vehicles, and move to electronic receipts if possible. If these drivers need to spend the night in the greater New York City area, they should stay in their hotel rooms or sleeper cab, when available, to the extent possible and continue to practice social distancing. Drivers who take these precautions should not need to self-quarantine when they leave the greater New York area, unless self-quarantine is recommended by state or local officials for all residents in the areas where they live. Truck drivers and other workers who obtain or deliver needed supplies who live in the greater New York area may continue to work both within and outside of the greater New York area but should stay at home and practice social distancing according to instructions of state and local officials when they are not working. While they are working either within or outside of the greater New York area, they should stay in their vehicles as much as possible, avoid being within 6 feet of others as much as possible when they exit their vehicles, and move to electronic receipts if possible. We continue to recommend that all people take precautions to stay safe and keep others safe, including washing their hands regularly, staying home when sick, covering coughs and sneezes, and maintaining distance from others. It remains our guidance that residents who were recently in the affected areas of New York, out of an abundance of caution, should self-quarantine for 14 days. ### U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICESexternal icon CDC works 24/7 protecting America\u2019s health, safety and security.

However, all healthcare facilities can take steps now to prepare for such an outbreak and protect both their patients and staff. Be prepared: Stay informed about the local COVID-19 situation. Know where to turn for reliable, up-to-date information in your local community. Monitor the CDC COVID-19 website and your state and local health department websitesexternal icon for the latest information. Develop, or review, your facility\u2019s emergency plan. A COVID-19 outbreak in your community could lead to staff absenteeism. Prepare alternative staffing plans to ensure as many of your facility\u2019s staff are available as possible. Establish relationships with key healthcare and public health partners in your community. Make sure you know about healthcare and public health emergency planning and response activities in your community. Learn about plans to manage patients, accept transfers, and share supplies. Review any memoranda of understanding (MOUs) with affiliates, your healthcare coalition, and other partners to provide support or assistance during emergencies. Create an emergency contact list. Develop and continuously update emergency contact lists for key partners and ensure the lists are accessible in key locations in your facility. For example, know how to reach your local or state health department in an emergency. Communicate with staff and patients: Communicate about COVID-19 with your staff. Share information about what is currently known about COVID-19, the potential for surge, and your facility\u2019s preparedness plans. Communicate about COVID-19 with your patients. Provide updates about changes to your policies regarding appointments, providing non-urgent patient care by telephone, and visitors. Consider using your facility\u2019s website or social media pages to share updates. Protect your workforce: Screen patients and visitors for symptoms of acute respiratory illness (e.g., fever, cough, difficulty breathing) before entering your healthcare facility. Keep up to date on the recommendations for preventing spread of COVID-19 on CDC\u2019s website. Ensure proper use of personal protection equipment (PPE). Healthcare personnel who come in close contact with confirmed or possible patients with COVID-19 should wear the appropriate personal protective equipment. Conduct an inventory of available PPE. Consider conducting an inventory of available PPE supplies. Explore strategies to optimize PPE supplies. Encourage sick employees to stay home. Personnel who develop respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) should be instructed not to report to work. Ensure that your sick leave policies are flexible and consistent with public health guidance and that employees are aware of these policies. Protect your patients: Stay up-to-date on the best ways to manage patients with COVID-19. Separate patients with respiratory symptoms so they are not waiting among other patients seeking care.\u00a0Identify a separate, well-ventilated space that allows waiting patients and visitors to be separated. Consider the strategies to prevent patients who can be cared for at home from coming to your facility potentially exposing themselves or others to germs, like: Using your telephone system to deliver messages to incoming callers about when to seek medical care at your facility, when to seek emergency care, and where to go for information about caring for a person with COVID at home. Adjusting your hours of operation to include telephone triage and follow-up of patients during a community outbreak. Leveraging telemedicine technologies and self-assessment tools. Top of Page"}

Decisions on the allocation of stockpiled ventilators to facilities should be based on multiple factors, including:1 Assessment of need Determination of facilities\u2019 ability to absorb additional ventilators Ethical considerations to inform how this scarce resource is provided to facilities to save as many lives as possible Input from state and local leadership, legal and ethical experts, and informed stakeholders State and local planners can use the strategies in this guide to assist them when allocating ventilators from public health stockpiles to hospitals and other facilities during a pandemic. Assessment of need: Use available surveillance data to predict the number of ventilators needed2 Growth in number of daily cases (increasing, stable, decreasing) Number of hospitalizations Percentage of hospitalizations with critical illness requiring critical care Percentage of critically ill patients needing ventilatory support Assess the number of ventilators currently available for use by each facility Ventilators currently not in use or in storage Ventilators anticipated to be available from surge contracts or sharing agreements Ventilators in use that may be available for future use Facility\u2019s ability to absorb additional ventilators: Identify facilities that may have capacity to care for critically ill patients who will need mechanical ventilation (from prior or current assessments). Quantify the number of additional ventilators each facility can realistically absorb. Base this estimate on having enough trained and qualified staff, space, and necessary equipment needed for caring for additional patients on mechanical ventilation.3 Determine the population size that each hospital serves and assess the capacity of each facility to serve vulnerable and high-risk populations within this area. Consider whether each hospital serves as a referral hospital/regional hospital or serves a high-density population area, rural area, or underserved populations. Ethical considerations to inform ventilator allocation:4 Use ethical principles to guide the development and implementation of ventilator allocation plans. Will the allocation plan use scarce resources in a manner that will save as many lives as possible?5 Does the allocation plan apply criteria consistently across all hospitals/facilities in the jurisdiction? If ventilators are insufficient to meet the needs of all those who would benefit from them, what are plans for providing care for patients who cannot access them? Does the plan include ways to clearly and transparently communicate the framework for allocation decisions to facility leadership, stakeholders, and to the general public? Develop a plan for logistical issues for distribution: Create distribution plans assuming that once ventilators have been allocated to a facility, they are unlikely to be reallocated. Ensure that ventilators stockpiled locally are ready to be put into service. References: Koonin LM, Pillai S, Kahn EB, Moulia D, Patel A.

As you create and update your preparedness plans, work with your local health officials to determine the most appropriate plan and actions for your school or program. Together, you will need to consider your local community situation\u2014whether you have local transmission in your community, and if so, the level of transmission (none/minimal, minimal to moderate, substantial). CDC has created overall guidance, as well as guidance tailored for transmission level in your area to help child care programs, schools, and their partners understand how to help prevent COVID-19 and react quickly when a case is identified. \u00a0The guidance includes information about the following: How to prepare if you have no community spread of COVID-19. How to prepare if you have minimal to moderate community spread in your community. How to prepare if you have substantial community spread in your community. What to do if a person with COVID-19 has entered your school. See CDC\u2019s full interim guidance for more details. What can staff and students do to prevent the spread of COVID-19?Encourage students and staff to take everyday preventive actions\u00a0to prevent the spread of respiratory illnesses. These actions include staying home when sick; appropriately covering coughs and sneezes; cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces; and washing hands often with soap and water. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if they are visibly dirty. Remember to supervise young children when they use hand sanitizer to prevent swallowing alcohol. How should my school prepare when there is no community transmission in our area?The most important thing you can do now is to prepare. Schools need to be ready if COVID-19 does appear in their communities. Here are some strategies: Review, update, and implement emergency operations plans. Develop information-sharing systems with partners. Teach and reinforce health hygiene practices. Intensify cleaning and disinfection efforts. Monitor and plan for absenteeism. Assess group gatherings and events. Follow current guidance about non-critical gatherings and events. Require sick students and staff to stay home. Establish procedures for students and staff who are sick at school. Create and test communications plans for use with the school community. Review CDC\u2019s guidance for business and employers. What should I include in my emergency operations plan?Review and update your emergency operations plan in collaboration with your local health departmentexternal iconexternal icon. Focus on the components or annexes of the plans that address infectious disease outbreaks. Ensure the plan includes strategies to reduce the spread of a wide variety of infectious diseases (e.g., seasonal influenza). This includes strategies for social distancing and school dismissal that may be used to stop or slow the spread of infectious disease. The plan should also include strategies for continuing education, meal programs, and other related services in the event of school dismissal. Ensure the plan emphasizes everyday preventive actions for students and staff. For example, emphasize actions such as staying home when sick; appropriately covering coughs and sneezes; cleaning frequently touched surfaces; and washing hands often. How should my school prepare when there is minimal to moderate community transmission in our area?Work with your local health officials to determine a set of strategies appropriate for your community\u2019s situation. Continue using the preparedness strategies implemented for no community transmission, and consider the following social distancing strategies: Cancel field trips, assemblies, and other large gatherings. Cancel or modify classes where students are likely to be in very close contact. Increase the space between desks to at least 6 feet. Stagger arrival and/or dismissal times. Reduce congestion in the health office. Limit nonessential visitors. Limit bringing in students from other schools for special programs (e.g., music, robotics, academic clubs) Teach staff, students, and their families to maintain a safe distance (6 feet) from each other in the school. What should I do when there is substantial community transmission?If local health officials have determined there is substantial transmission of COVID-19 within the community, they will provide guidance to administrators on the best course of action for child care programs or schools. These strategies are expected to extend across multiple programs, schools, or school districts within the community. You may need to consider extended school dismissals (e.g. dismissals for longer than 2 weeks). This longer-term, and likely broader-reaching, dismissal strategy is intended to slow transmission rates of COVID-19 in the community. During extended school dismissals, also cancel extracurricular group activities, school-based afterschool programs, and large events (e.g., assemblies, spirit nights, field trips, and sporting events). Remember to implement strategies to ensure the continuity of education (e.g., distance learning) as well as meal programs and other essential services for students. Should my school screen students for COVID-19?Schools and child care programs are\u00a0not expected\u00a0to screen children, students, or staff to identify cases of COVID-19. If a community (or more specifically, a school) has cases of COVID-19, local health officials will help identify those individuals and follow up on next steps. What resources does CDC have available to share with staff, students, and parents?Share resources with the school community to help them understand COVID-19 and steps they can take to protect themselves: CDC\u2019s health communication resources CDC information on stigma and COVID-19 CDC information on COVID-19 and children CDC offers several free handwashing resources that include health promotion materials, information on proper handwashing technique, and tips for families to help children develop good handwashing habits. Other health and education professional organizations may also have helpful resources your school can use or share, such as the American Academy of Pediatricsexternal iconexternal icon CDC\u2019s information on helping children cope with emergencies Stigma prevention and facts about COVID-19 What should I do if my school experiences increased rates of absenteeism?If your school notices a substantial increase in the number of students or staff missing school due to illness, report this to your local health officials. What steps should my school take if a student or staff member shows symptoms of COVID-19?You should establish procedures to ensure students and staff who become sick at school or who arrive at school sick are sent home as soon as possible. Keep anyone sick separate from well students and staff until the sick person can be sent home. What should I do if the suspected sick student or staff member is confirmed to have COVID-19?Immediately notify local health officials. These officials will help administrators determine a course of action for their child care programs or schools. You will likely dismiss students and most staff for 2-5 days. This initial short-term dismissal allows time for the local health officials to gain a better understanding of the COVID-19 situation impacting the school and for custodial staff to clean and disinfect the affected facilities. Work with the local health officials to determine appropriate next steps, including whether an extended dismissal duration is needed to stop or slow further spread of COVID-19."}

The CDC continues to recommend the use of alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) as the primary method for hand hygiene in most clinical situations1. ABHR effectively reduces the number of pathogens that may be present on the hands of healthcare personnel after brief interactions with patients or the care environment. In addition, frequent use of ABHR formulated with emollients is less damaging to the skin than frequent hand washing. This factor, along with ease of use and greater access, leads to greater overall compliance with use of ABHR than hand washing with soap and water.\u00a0 Hands should be washed for at least 20 seconds with soap and water when visibly soiled, before eating, and after using the restroom. Are benzalkonium chloride-containing hand rub products an acceptable alternative to ABHR for COVID-19? CDC does not have a recommended alternative to hand rub products with greater than 60% ethanol or 70% isopropanol as active ingredients. Benzalkonium chloride, along with both ethanol and isopropanol, is deemed eligible by FDAexternal icon for use in the formulation of healthcare personnel hand rubs2. \u00a0However, available evidence indicates benzalkonium chloride has less reliable activity against coronavirus than either of the alcohols3. How should healthcare organizations respond to severe shortages of ABHR? Healthcare organizations that encounter severe shortages of ABHR (and have exhausted supply chain access to efficacious products) may consider local production of formulations as described by the FDA\u00a0Policy for Compounding of Certain Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizer Productsexternal icon. This policy remains in effect through April 30, 2020. Formulations included in the FDA guidance are consistent with World Health Organization production guidancepdf iconexternal icon.\u00a0These locally produced products are intended for routine healthcare personnel hand cleaning, must not contain active ingredients other than those specified in the FDA guidance, and should not take the place of other regulated skin antiseptics (e.g. surgical hand rub). To avoid contamination with spore-forming organisms, WHO formulations require a 72-hour post-production quarantine. Organizations should revert to the use of commercially produced, FDA-approved product once such supplies again become available. Can healthcare facilities substitute unformulated ethanol in concentrations greater than 60% or isopropanol greater than 70% for use as alcohol-based hand rub? Given the drying effect of alcohols and the importance of maintaining skin integrity of healthcare personnel with their need to perform hand hygiene frequently, alcohols should not be used unless properly formulated with emollients."}

Continue using the preparedness strategies implemented for no community transmission, and consider the following social distancing strategies: Cancel large gatherings Cancel or modify courses where students are likely to be in very close contact. Increase space between desks. Reduce congestion in the health clinic. Consider if and how existing dining services should be scaled back or adapted. What should I do if there is substantial community transmission?If local health officials have determined there is substantial transmission of COVID-19 within the community, they will provide guidance to administrators on the best course of action for their college or university. Similar strategies will extend across organizations (e.g., K-12 schools, business, community and faith-based organizations) in a collective effort to stop the spread of COVID-19. Measures will likely include extended class suspension and event/activity cancellations (e.g., suspension/cancellations for longer than two weeks). This longer-term, and likely broader-reaching, strategy is intended to slow transmission rates of COVID-19 in the community. During extended class suspensions, cancel extracurricular group activities and large events. Remember to implement strategies to ensure the continuity of education, research, and housing as well as meal programs and other essential services for students. What should we do if a student, staff or faculty member shows symptoms of COVID-19?You should establish procedures for anyone who becomes sick or arrives sick on campus. Sick students, staff and faculty should be separated from others, given a mask to wear, if available and sent to their place or residence as soon as possible. Sick residents of on-campus housing should avoid contact with individuals who are healthy. What should we do if we have a confirmed case of COVID-19 on campus or identify someone who was on campus?Immediately notify local health officials. These officials will help administrators determine a course of action for your college or university. Administrators should work closely with their local health officials to determine if a short-term closure (for 2-5 days) of all campus buildings and facilities is needed. In some cases, you may only need to close buildings and facilities that had been entered by the individual(s) with COVID-19.

Work with the local health officials to determine appropriate next steps, including whether an extended dismissal duration is needed to stop or slow further spread of COVID-19. If there is substantial transmission in the local community, local health officials may suggest extended school dismissals. This longer-term, and likely broader-reaching, dismissal strategy is intended to slow transmission rates of COVID-19 in the community. How long should colleges or universities be dismissed?It depends on the situation at your school and community. You may need to temporarily dismiss school for 2-5 days, if someone with COVID-19 was on campus. This initial short-term dismissal allows time for the local health officials to gain a better understanding of the COVID-19 situation impacting the school and for custodial staff to clean and disinfect the affected facilities. The need for an extended dismissal will be made based on what officials discover from contact tracing. If there is substantial transmission in the local community, local health officials may suggest extended school dismissals. This longer-term, and likely broader-reaching, dismissal strategy is intended to slow transmission rates of COVID-19 in the community. Should we continue teaching and/or research activities if we decide to dismiss classes?Yes, consider ways that your college/university can adapt or use alternative teaching methods. Review continuity plans, including plans for the continuity of teaching, learning, and research. Implement e-learning plans and distance learning options as feasible and appropriate. Ensure continuity plans address how to temporarily postpone, limit, or adapt research-related activities (e.g., study recruitment or participation, access to labs) in a manner that protects the safety of researchers, participants, facilities, and equipment. Consider the following approaches: Use of existing infrastructure and services (e.g., Blackboard, Skype, Zoom) to support efficient transition of classes from in-person to distance-based formats. This may include using strategies such as faculty check-ins, recorded class meetings or lectures, and live class meetings. Other student support services such as online library services, print materials available online, phone- or Internet-based counseling support, or study groups enabled through digital media. Institutes of higher education should determine, in consultation with their university system: How to convert face-to-face lessons into online lessons and how to train faculty to do so. How to triage technical issues if faced with limited IT support and staff How to deal with the potential lack of students\u2019 access to computers and the Internet at home or in temporary housing. Should we temporarily cancel extracurricular group activities and large events?If your community has cases of COVID-19, work with your local public health officials to determine if you should temporarily cancel events. If you decide to dismiss classes, you should also cancel extracurricular group activities and large events, such as club meetings, performances, social events, athletic team practices, and sporting events. You should also discourage students, staff, and faculty from gathering or socializing elsewhere. If classes are dismissed, how should we decide when to re-open the campus?Schools should work with local health officials to assess when students, staff and faculty can return to campus. Recent TravelWhat should we do if a student or staff member recently traveled to an area with COVID-19 or has a family member who has traveled to an area with COVID-19?Review updated CDC information for travelers, including FAQ for travelers, and consult with state and local health officials.

Purpose: This document offers a series of strategies or options to optimize supplies of facemasks in healthcare settings when there is limited supply. It does not address other aspects of pandemic planning; for those, healthcare facilities can refer to COVID-19 preparedness plans. Surge capacity refers to the ability to manage a sudden, unexpected increase in patient volume that would otherwise severely challenge or exceed the present capacity of a facility. While there are no commonly accepted measurements or triggers to distinguish surge capacity from daily patient care capacity, surge capacity is a useful framework to approach a decreased supply of facemasks during the COVID-19 response. Three general strata have been used to describe surge capacity and can be used to prioritize measures to conserve facemask supplies along the continuum of care. Conventional capacity: measures consist of providing patient care without any change in daily contemporary practices. This set of measures, consisting of engineering, administrative, and personal protective equipment (PPE) controls should already be implemented in general infection prevention and control plans in healthcare settings. Contingency capacity: measures may change daily standard practices but may not have any significant impact on the care delivered to the patient or the safety of healthcare personnel (HCP). These practices may be used temporarily during periods of expected facemask shortages. Crisis capacity: strategies that are not commensurate with U.S. standards of care. These measures, or a combination of these measures, may need to be considered during periods of known facemask shortages. The following contingency and crisis strategies are based upon these assumptions: Facilities understand their facemask inventory and supply chain Facilities understand their facemask utilization rate Facilities are in communication with local healthcare coalitions, federal, state, and local public health partners (e.g., public health emergency preparedness and response staff) regarding identification of additional supplies. Facilities have already implemented other engineering and administrative control measures including: Reducing the number of patients going to the hospital or outpatient settings Excluding HCP not essential for patient care from entering their care area Reducing face-to-face HCP encounters with patients Excluding visitors to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 Cohorting patients and HCP Maximizing use of telemedicine Facilities have provided HCP with required education and training, including having them demonstrate competency with donning and doffing, with any PPE ensemble that is used to perform job responsibilities, such as provision of patient care Conventional Capacity Strategies Use facemasks according to product labeling and local, state, and federal requirements. FDA-cleared surgical masks are designed to protect against splashes and sprays and are prioritized for use when such exposures are anticipated, including surgical procedures. Facemasks that are not regulated by FDA, such as some procedure masks, which are typically used for isolation purposes, may not provide protection against splashes and sprays. Contingency Capacity Strategies Selectively cancel elective and non-urgent procedures and appointments for which a facemask is typically used by HCP. Remove facemasks for visitors in public areas. Healthcare facilities can consider removing all facemasks from public areas. Facemasks can be available to provide to symptomatic patients upon check in at entry points. All facemasks should be placed in a secure and monitored site. This is especially important in high-traffic areas like emergency departments. Implement extended use of facemasks. Extended use of facemasks is the practice of wearing the same facemask for repeated close contact encounters with several different patients, without removing the facemask between patient encounters. The facemask should be removed and discarded if soiled, damaged, or hard to breathe through. HCP must take care not to touch their facemask. If they touch or adjust their facemask they must immediately perform hand hygiene. HCP should leave the patient care area if they need to remove the facemask. Restrict facemasks to use by HCP, rather than patients for source control. Have patients with symptoms of respiratory infection use tissues or other barriers to cover their mouth and nose. Crisis Capacity Strategies Cancel all elective and non-urgent procedures and appointments for which a facemask is typically used by HCP. Use facemasks beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life during patient care activities. If there is no date available on the facemask label or packaging, facilities should contact the manufacturer. The user should visually inspect the product prior to use and, if there are concerns (such as degraded materials or visible tears), discard the product. Implement limited re-use of facemasks. Limited re-use of facemasks is the practice of using the same facemask by one HCP for multiple encounters with different patients but removing it after each encounter. As it is unknown what the potential contribution of contact transmission is for SARS-CoV-2, care should be taken to ensure that HCP do not touch outer surfaces of the mask during care, and that mask removal and replacement be done in a careful and deliberate manner. The facemask should be removed and discarded if soiled, damaged, or hard to breathe through. Not all facemasks can be re-used. Facemasks that fasten to the provider via ties may not be able to be undone without tearing and should be considered only for extended use, rather than re-use. Facemasks with elastic ear hooks may be more suitable for re-use. HCP should leave patient care area if they need to remove the facemask. Facemasks should be carefully folded so that the outer surface is held inward and against itself to reduce contact with the outer surface during storage. The folded mask can be stored between uses in a clean sealable paper bag or breathable container. Prioritize facemasks for selected activities such as: For provision of essential surgeries and procedures During care activities where splashes and sprays are anticipated During activities where prolonged face-to-face or close contact with a potentially infectious patient is unavoidable For performing aerosol generating procedures, if respirators are no longer available When No Facemasks Are Available, Options Include Exclude HCP at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 from contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients. During severe resource limitations, consider excluding HCP who may be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19, such as those of older age, those with chronic medical conditions, or those who may be pregnant, from caring for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection. Designate convalescent HCP for provision of care to known or suspected COVID-19 patients. It may be possible to designate HCP who have clinically recovered from COVID-19 to preferentially provide care for additional patients with COVID-19. Individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 infection may have developed some protective immunity, but this has not yet been confirmed. Use a face shield that covers the entire front (that extends to the chin or below) and sides of the face with no facemask. Consider use of expedient patient isolation rooms for risk reduction. Portable fan devices with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration that are carefully placed can increase the effective air changes per hour of clean air to the patient room, reducing risk to individuals entering the room without respiratory protection. NIOSH has developed guidance for using portable HEPA filtration systems to create expedient patient isolation rooms. The expedient patient isolation room approach involves establishing a high-ventilation-rate, negative pressure, inner isolation zone that sits within a \u201cclean\u201d larger ventilated zone. Consider use of ventilated headboards NIOSH has developed the ventilated headboard that draws exhaled air from a patient in bed into a HEPA filter, decreasing risk of HCP exposure to patient-generated aerosol. This technology consists of lightweight, sturdy, and adjustable aluminum framing with a retractable plastic canopy. The ventilated headboard can be deployed in combination with HEPA fan/filter units to provide surge isolation capacity within a variety of environments, from traditional patient rooms to triage stations, and emergency medical shelters. HCP use of homemade masks: In settings where facemasks are not available, HCP might use homemade masks (e.g., bandana, scarf) for care of patients with COVID-19 as a last resort. However, homemade masks are not considered PPE, since their capability to protect HCP is unknown. Caution should be exercised when considering this option. Homemade masks should ideally be used in combination with a face shield that covers the entire front (that extends to the chin or below) and sides of the face."}

Purpose: This document offers a series of strategies or options to optimize supplies of eye protection in healthcare settings when there is limited supply. It does not address other aspects of pandemic planning; for those, healthcare facilities can refer to COVID-19 preparedness plans. Surge capacity refers to the ability to manage a sudden, unexpected increase in patient volume that would otherwise severely challenge or exceed the present capacity of a facility. While there are no commonly accepted measurements or triggers to distinguish surge capacity from daily patient care capacity, surge capacity is a useful framework to approach a decreased supply of eye protection during the COVID-19 response.

Contingency Capacity Strategies Selectively cancel elective and non-urgent procedures and appointments for which eye protection is typically used by HCP. Shift eye protection supplies from disposable to re-usable devices (i.e., goggles and reusable face shields). Consider preferential use of powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs) or full-face elastomeric respirators which have built-in eye protection. Ensure appropriate cleaning and disinfection between users if goggles or reusable face shields are used. Implement extended use of eye protection. Extended use of eye protection is the practice of wearing the same eye protection for repeated close contact encounters with several different patients, without removing eye protection between patient encounters. Extended use of eye protection can be applied to disposable and reusable devices. Eye protection should be removed and reprocessed if it becomes visibly soiled or difficult to see through. If a disposable face shield is reprocessed, it should be dedicated to one HCP and reprocessed whenever it is visibly soiled or removed (e.g., when leaving the isolation area) prior to putting it back on. See protocol for removing and reprocessing eye protection below. Eye protection should be discarded if damaged (e.g., face shield can no longer fasten securely to the provider, if visibility is obscured and reprocessing does not restore visibility). HCP should take care not to touch their eye protection. If they touch or adjust their eye protection they must immediately perform hand hygiene. HCP should leave patient care area if they need to remove their eye protection. See protocol for removing and reprocessing eye protection below. Crisis Capacity Strategies Cancel all elective and non-urgent procedures and appointments for which eye protection is typically used by HCP. Use eye protection devices beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life during patient care activities. If there is no date available on the eye protection device label or packaging, facilities should contact the manufacturer. The user should visually inspect the product prior to use and, if there are concerns (such as degraded materials), discard the product. Prioritize eye protection for selected activities such as: During care activities where splashes and sprays are anticipated, which typically includes aerosol generating procedures. During activities where prolonged face-to-face or close contact with a potentially infectious patient is unavoidable. Consider using safety glasses (e.g., trauma glasses) that have extensions to cover the side of the eyes. Exclude HCP at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 from contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients. During severe resource limitations, consider excluding HCP who may be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19, such as those of older age, those with chronic medical conditions, or those who may be pregnant, from caring for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection. Designate convalescent HCP for provision of care to known or suspected COVID-19 patients. It may be possible to designate HCP who have clinically recovered from COVID-19 to preferentially provide care for additional patients with COVID-19. Individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 infection may have developed some protective immunity, but this has not yet been confirmed. Selected Options for Reprocessing Eye Protection Adhere to recommended manufacturer instructions for cleaning and disinfection. When manufacturer instructions for cleaning and disinfection are unavailable, such as for single use disposable face shields, consider: While wearing gloves, carefully wipe the inside, followed by the outside of the face shield or goggles using a clean cloth saturated with neutral detergent solution or cleaner wipe. Carefully wipe the outside of the face shield or goggles using a wipe or clean cloth saturated with EPA-registered hospital disinfectant solution. Wipe the outside of face shield or goggles with clean water or alcohol to remove residue. Fully dry (air dry or use clean absorbent towels). Remove gloves and perform hand hygiene."}

Purpose: This document offers a series of strategies or options to optimize supplies of isolation gowns in healthcare settings when there is limited supply. It does not address other aspects of pandemic planning; for those, healthcare facilities can refer to COVID-19 preparedness plans. Surge capacity refers to the ability to manage a sudden, unexpected increase in patient volume that would otherwise severely challenge or exceed the present capacity of a facility. While there are no widely accepted measurements or triggers to distinguish surge capacity from daily patient care capacity, surge capacity is a useful framework to approach a decreased supply of isolation gowns during the COVID-19 response. Three general strata have been used to describe surge capacity and can be used to prioritize measures to conserve isolation gown supplies along the continuum of care. Conventional capacity: measures consist of providing patient care without any change in daily contemporary practices. This set of measures, consisting of engineering, administrative, and personal protective equipment (PPE) controls should already be implemented in general infection prevention and control plans in healthcare settings. Contingency capacity: measures may change daily standard practices but may not have any significant impact on the care delivered to the patient or the safety of healthcare personnel (HCP). These practices may be used temporarily during periods of expected isolation gown shortages. Crisis capacity: strategies that are not commensurate with standard U.S. standards of care. These measures, or a combination of these measures, may need to be considered during periods of known isolation gown shortages. The following contingency and crisis strategies are based upon these assumptions: Facilities understand their current isolation gown inventory and supply chain Facilities understand their isolation gown utilization rate Facilities are in communication with local healthcare coalitions, federal, state, and local public health partners (e.g., public health emergency preparedness and response staff) regarding identification of additional supplies Facilities have already implemented other engineering and administrative control measures including: Reducing the number of patients going to the hospital or outpatient settings Excluding HCP not directly involved in patient care Reducing face-to-face HCP encounters with patients Excluding visitors to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 Cohorting patients and HCP Maximizing use of telemedicine Facilities have provided HCP with required education and training, including having them demonstrate competency with donning and doffing, with any PPE ensemble that is used to perform job responsibilities, such as provision of patient care Conventional Capacity Strategies Use isolation gown alternatives that offer equivalent or higher protection. Several fluid-resistant and impermeable protective clothing options are available in the marketplace for HCP. These include isolation gowns and surgical gowns. When selecting the most appropriate protective clothing, employers should consider all of the available information on recommended protective clothing, including the potential limitations. Nonsterile, disposable patient isolation gowns, which are used for routine patient care in healthcare settings, are appropriate for use by HCP when caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. In times of gown shortages, surgical gowns should be prioritized for surgical and other sterile procedures. Current U.S. guidelines do not require use of gowns that conform to any standards. Contingency Capacity Strategies Selectively cancel elective and non-urgent procedures and appointments for which a gown is typically used by HCP. Shift gown use towards cloth isolation gowns. Reusable (i.e., washable) gowns are typically made of polyester or polyester-cotton fabrics. Gowns made of these fabrics can be safely laundered according to routine procedures\u00a0and reused. Care should be taken to ensure that HCP do not touch outer surfaces of the gown during care. Laundry operations and personnel may need to be augmented to facilitate additional washing loads and cycles Systems are established to routinely inspect, maintain (e.g., mend a small hole in a gown, replace missing fastening ties), and replace reusable gowns when needed (e.g., when they are thin or ripped) Consider the use of coveralls. Coveralls typically provide 360-degree protection because they are designed to cover the whole body, including the back and lower legs, and sometimes the head and feet as well. While the material and seam barrier properties are essential for defining the protective level, the coverage provided by the material used in the garment design, as well as certain features including closures, will greatly affect the protective level. HCP unfamiliar with the use of coveralls must be trained and practiced in their use, prior to using during patient care. In the United States, the NFPA 1999 standardexternal icon specifies the minimum design, performance, testing, documentation, and certification requirements for new single-use and new multiple-use emergency medical operations protective clothing, including coveralls for HCP. Use of expired gowns beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life for training. The majority of isolation gowns do not have a manufacturer-designated shelf life. However, consideration can be made to using gowns that do and are past their manufacturer-designated shelf life. If there is no date available on the gown label or packaging, facilities should contact the manufacturer. Use gowns or coveralls conforming to international standards. Current guidelines do not require use of gowns that conform to any standards. In times of shortages, healthcare facilities can consider using international gowns and coveralls. Gowns and coveralls that conform to international standards, including with EN 13795 and EN14126, could be reserved for activities that may involve moderate to high amounts of body fluids. Crisis Capacity Strategies Cancel all elective and non-urgent procedures and appointments for which a gown is typically used by HCP. Extended use of isolation gowns. Consideration can be made to extend the use of isolation gowns (disposable or cloth) such that the same gown is worn by the same HCP when interacting with more than one patient known to be infected with the same infectious disease when these patients housed in the same location (i.e., COVID-19 patients residing in an isolation cohort). This can be considered only if there are no additional co-infectious diagnoses transmitted by contact (such as Clostridioides difficile) among patients. If the gown becomes visibly soiled, it must be removed and discarded as per usual practicespdf icon. Re-use of cloth isolation gowns. Disposable gowns are not typically amenable to being doffed and re-used because the ties and fasteners typically break during doffing. Cloth isolation gowns could potentially be untied and retied and could be considered for re-use without laundering in between. In a situation where the gown is being used as part of standard precautions to protect HCP from a splash, the risk of re-using a non-visibly soiled cloth isolation gown may be lower. However, for care of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, HCP risk from re-use of cloth isolation gowns without laundering among (1) single HCP caring for multiple patients using one gown or (2) among multiple HCP sharing one gown is unclear. The goal of this strategy is to minimize exposures to HCP and not necessarily prevent transmission between patients. Any gown that becomes visibly soiled during patient care should be disposed of and cleaned. Prioritize gowns. Gowns should be prioritized for the following activities: During care activities where splashes and sprays are anticipated, which typically includes aerosol generating procedures During the following high-contact patient care activities that provide opportunities for transfer of pathogens to the hands and clothing of healthcare providers, such as: Dressing, bathing/showering, transferring, providing hygiene, changing linens, changing briefs or assisting with toileting, device care or use, wound care Surgical gowns should be prioritized for surgical and other sterile procedures. Facilities may consider suspending use of gowns for endemic multidrug resistant organisms (e.g., MRSA, VRE, ESBL-producing organisms). When No Gowns Are Available Consider using gown alternatives that have not been evaluated as effective. In situation of severely limited or no available isolation gowns, the following pieces of clothing can be considered as a last resort for care of COVID-19 patients as single use. However, none of these options can be considered PPE, since their capability to protect HCP is unknown. Preferable features include long sleeves and closures (snaps, buttons) that can be fastened and secured. Disposable laboratory coats Reusable (washable) patient gowns Reusable (washable) laboratory coats Disposable aprons Combinations of clothing: Combinations of pieces of clothing can be considered for activities that may involve body fluids and when there are no gowns available: Long sleeve aprons in combination with long sleeve patient gowns or laboratory coats Open back gowns with long sleeve patient gowns or laboratory coats Sleeve covers in combination with aprons and long sleeve patient gowns or laboratory coats Reusable patient gowns and lab coats can be safely laundered according to routine procedures. Laundry operations and personnel may need to be augmented to facilitate additional washing loads and cycles Systems are established to routinely inspect, maintain (e.g., mend a small hole in a gown, replace missing fastening ties) and replace reusable gowns when needed (e.g., when they are thin or ripped)"}

This is a rapidly evolving situation. Guidance will be updated as new information becomes available. States may have their own specific requirements for these circumstances. Purpose: This interim guidance is for public health professionals managing the home care and isolation of people with COVID-19 who have pets or other animals (including service or working animals) in the same home. The intent of this guidance is to facilitate preparedness and establish practices that can help people and animals stay safe and healthy. At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets, can spread COVID-19. Definitions Used in this Guidance Household animals, for the purposes of this document, refers to companion animals, including pets and service animals, that live in a home or on the premises of a home. This document does not address instances where a person with COVID-19 interacts with livestock (e.g., pigs, goats, sheep or cattle), wildlife, or other animals on their premises or through duties outside their home. Public health veterinarian, for the purposes of this document, refers to the state public health veterinarian or designated public health official responsible for handling animal-related public health issues in their jurisdiction. When to Contact a State Public Health Veterinarian A state public health veterinarianpdf iconexternal icon should be contacted by public health professionals, animal health professionals or veterinarians that have discovered a household animal with a new, concerning illness and that resides with a person with COVID-19. Some jurisdictions do not have state public health veterinarians, or geographic, resource, or time limitations may prevent public health veterinarian from managing a situation involving household animals. Suggested Guidance for Homes with Household Animals In addition to other prevention measures, people with COVID-19 and in-home isolation should be advised to limit interaction with household animals. Specifically, while a person infected with COVID-19 is symptomatic, they should maintain separation from household animals as they would with other household members, and avoid direct contact with pets, including petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, sleeping in the same location, and sharing food. In accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Actexternal icon, service animals should be permitted to remain with their handlers. If possible, a household member should be designated to care for pets in the home and should follow standard handwashing practices before and after interacting with the household animal. If a person with COVID-19 must care for pets, they should ensure they wash their hands before and after caring for pets. Care for household animals that are sick or injured should be coordinated with the household\u2019s local veterinarian. In order to ensure the veterinary clinic is prepared for the household animal, the owner should call ahead and arrange the hospital or clinic visit. If an owner is sick with COVID-19, a family member or friend from outside the household may bring the animal to a veterinary hospital or clinic. Telemedicine may also be appropriate to provide consultation with a veterinarian if the owner is a COVID-19 case and is unable to find an alternative caretaker to bring the pet to the hospital. Veterinarians that see animals that have a new, concerning illness and reside with a person with COVID-19 should contact their state public health veterinarianpdf iconexternal icon. In some instances, household animals may require alternative care or re-homing if the owner is unable to care for the animal or has surrendered the animal. A home receiving a new household animal should follow standard handwashing practices before and after interacting with the animal. Shelters receiving household animals should ensure they review and adhere to their established biosafety and biosecurity practices for infectious diseases. Suggested Communications with Community Veterinarians At this time there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets, can become sick with or spread COVID-19. At this time, there is no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 can spread to people from the skin or fur of companion animals. Veterinarians and their staff should review and adhere to their biosafety and biosecurity protocols for infectious diseases to ensure the safety of their patients. Veterinarians and their staff should review the concepts in NASPHV Compendium of Veterinary Standard Precautions for Zoonotic Disease Prevention in Veterinary Personnelexternal icon. This document outlines routine infection prevention practices designed to minimize transmission of zoonotic pathogens from animals to veterinary personnel. These infection prevention and control guidelines should be consistently implemented in veterinary hospitals, regardless of ongoing outbreaks of infectious diseases, but are especially important during an outbreak of an emerging infectious disease such as COVID-19. Contact your state public health veterinarianpdf iconexternal icon if you are seeing a new, concerning illness in an animal that has had close contact with a person with COVID-19."}

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will update this interim guidance as needed and as additional information becomes available. This interim guidance is intended for organizers and staff responsible for planning mass gatherings or large community events in the United States. A mass gathering is a planned or spontaneous event with a large number of people in attendance that could strain the planning and response resources of the community hosting the event, such as a concert, festival, conference, or sporting event. Guidance specific to schools and childcare settings, institutions of higher education, and community- and faith-based organizations can be found on CDC\u2019s website focused on prevention COVID-19 spread in communities. COVID-19 is an emerging respiratory disease and there is more to learn about its transmission, clinical course, and populations at increased risk of disease and complications (see How COVID-19 Spreads). Everyone can do their part to help plan, prepare, and respond to this emerging public health threat. Older adults and persons with severe underlying health conditions are considered to be at increased risk of more serious illness after contracting COVID-19.\u00a0 Priority should be given to ensuring the safety of these groups of people, particularly for any mass gatherings that are expected to have a large number of older adults or persons with underlying conditions. As the COVID-19 outbreak evolves, CDC strongly encourages event organizers and staff to prepare for the possibility of outbreaks in their communities. Creating an emergency plan for mass gatherings and large community events can help protect you and the health of your event participants and the local community. CDC has developed recommended actions for preventing the spread of COVID-19 at mass gatherings and large community events. This guidance suggests strategies to help you plan for and implement ways in which to better protect all involved in a mass gathering. Organizers should continually assess, based on current conditions, whether to postpone, cancel, or significantly reduce the number of attendees (if possible) for mass gatherings. Listed below are some considerations organizers should keep in mind as they make decisions about whether to postpone or cancel an event. If organizers decide to proceed with an event they should consult the \u201cSteps to Plan, Prepare, and Proceed with a Mass Gathering\u201d section of this document."}

Updated EPA COVID Disinfectant link. Background There is much to learn about the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Based on what is currently known about SARS-CoV-2 and about similar coronaviruses, spread from person-to-person happens most frequently among close contacts (within about 6 feet). This type of transmission occurs via respiratory droplets. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to persons from surfaces contaminated with the virus has not been documented. Transmission of coronavirus in general occurs much more commonly through respiratory droplets than through contact with contaminated surfaces. Current evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may remain viable for hours to days on surfaces made from a variety of materials. Cleaning of visibly dirty surfaces followed by disinfection is a best practice measure for prevention of COVID-19 and other viral respiratory illnesses in election polling locations. Purpose This guidance provides recommendations on the routine cleaning and disinfection of polling location areas and associated voting equipment (e.g., pens, voting machines, computers). It suggests actions that polling station workers can take to reduce the risk of exposure to COVID-19 by limiting the survival of the virus in the environment. This guidance will be updated if additional information becomes available. Definitions: Community settings (e.g. polling locations, households, schools, daycares, businesses) encompass most non-healthcare settings and are visited by the general public. Cleaning refers to the removal of dirt and impurities including germs from surfaces. Cleaning alone does not kill germs. But by removing them, it decreases the number of germs and therefore any risk of spreading infection. Disinfecting kills germs on surfaces. Disinfecting works by using chemicals to kill germs on surfaces. This process does not necessarily clean dirty surfaces or remove germs. But killing germs remaining on a surface after cleaning further reduce any risk of spreading infection."}

{"title": "Interim Guidance for Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Systems and 911 Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) for COVID-19 in the United States", "time": "2020-3-10 00:00:00", "author": "", "link": "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-for-ems.html", "content": "This guidance applies to all first responders, including law enforcement, fire services, emergency medical services, and emergency management officials, who anticipate close contact with persons with confirmed or possible COVID-19 in the course of their work. Updated March 10, 2020 Summary of Key Changes for the EMS Guidance: Updated PPE recommendations for the care of patients with known or suspected COVID-19: Facemasks are an acceptable alternative until the supply chain is restored. Respirators should be prioritized for procedures that are likely to generate respiratory aerosols, which would pose the highest exposure risk to HCP. Eye protection, gown, and gloves continue to be recommended. If there are shortages of gowns, they should be prioritized for aerosol-generating procedures, care activities where splashes and sprays are anticipated, and high-contact patient care activities that provide opportunities for transfer of pathogens to the hands and clothing of HCP. When the supply chain is restored, fit-tested EMS clinicians should return to use of respirators for patients with known or suspected COVID-19. Updated guidance about recommended EPA-registered disinfectants to include reference to a list now posted on the EPA website. Background Emergency medical services (EMS) play a vital role in responding to requests for assistance, triaging patients, and providing emergency medical treatment and transport for ill persons. However, unlike patient care in the controlled environment of a healthcare facility, care and transports by EMS present unique challenges because of the nature of the setting, enclosed space during transport, frequent need for rapid medical decision-making, interventions with limited information, and a varying range of patient acuity and jurisdictional healthcare resources. When preparing for and responding to patients with confirmed or possible coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), close coordination and effective communications are important among 911 Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs)\u2014 commonly known as 911 call centers, the EMS system, healthcare facilities, and the public health system. Each PSAP and EMS system should seek the involvement of an EMS medical director to provide appropriate medical oversight. For the purposes of this guidance, \u201cEMS clinician\u201d means prehospital EMS and medical first responders. When COVID-19 is suspected in a patient needing emergency transport, prehospital care providers and healthcare facilities should be notified in advance that they may be caring for, transporting, or receiving a patient who may have COVID-19 infection. Updated information about COVID-19 Infection prevention and control recommendations Additional information for healthcare personnel Case Definition for COVID-19 CDC\u2019s most current case definition for a person under investigation (PUI) for COVID-19. Recommendations for 911 PSAPs Municipalities and local EMS authorities should coordinate with state and local public health, PSAPs, and other emergency call centers to determine need for modified caller queries about COVID-19, outlined below. Development of these modified caller queries should be closely coordinated with an EMS medical director and informed by local, state, and federal public health authorities, including the city or county health department(s), state health department(s), and CDC. Modified Caller Queries PSAPs or Emergency Medical Dispatch (EMD) centers (as appropriate) should question callers and determine the possibility that this call concerns a person who may have signs or symptoms and risk factors for COVID-19. The query process should never supersede the provision of pre-arrival instructions to the caller when immediate lifesaving interventions (e.g., CPR or the Heimlich maneuver) are indicated. Patients in the United States who meet the appropriate criteria should be evaluated and transported as a PUI. Information on COVID-19 will be updated as the public health response proceeds. PSAPs and medical directors can access CDC\u2019s PUI definitions here. Information on a possible PUI should be communicated immediately to EMS clinicians before arrival on scene in order to allow use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). PSAPs should utilize medical dispatch procedures that are coordinated with their EMS medical director and with the local or state public health department. PSAPs and EMS units that respond to ill travelers at US international airports or other ports of entry to the United States (maritime ports or border crossings) should be in contact with the CDC quarantine station of jurisdiction for the port of entry (see: CDC Quarantine Station Contact List) for planning guidance. They should notify the quarantine station when responding to that location if a communicable disease is suspected in a traveler. CDC has provided job aids for this purpose to EMS units operating routinely at US ports of entry. The PSAP or EMS unit can also call CDC\u2019s Emergency Operations Center at (770) 488-7100 to be connected with the appropriate CDC quarantine station."}

On January 22, 2020, CDC received a clinical specimen collected from the first U.S. patient infected with SARS-CoV-2. CDC immediately placed the specimen into cell-culture in order to grow a sufficient amount of virus for study. On February 2, 2020, CDC generated enough SARS-CoV-2 grown in cell culture to distribute externally. On February 4, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 was shipped from CDC to the BEI Resources Repository.
