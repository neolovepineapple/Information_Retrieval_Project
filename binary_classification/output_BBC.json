That includes staff working in care homes, prisons and other community settings as well as in GP surgeries or hospitals. \nThe type of PPE required depends on the level of risk. \nClinicians carrying out tasks that could generate airborne droplets of saliva loaded with the virus should use an even higher standard of protection, including disposable gowns, filtering respirators and face-shielding visors. \nFor example, that would include intensive care doctors getting a patient ready to go on a ventilator to support their breathing. \nThe ambulance driver does not need to wear any PPE, but the rest of the crew should wear the appropriate amount depending on the likely level of exposure and risk they face. \nPharmacy staff who cannot keep 2m away from possible patients should wear a surgical mask.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said that by the weekend of 18 and 19 April, one billion items of PPE would have been delivered in the UK.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care told BBC News on Sunday that between 25 February and 18 April there had been approximately 875 million items of PPE delivered to NHS Trusts and into social care systems in England. \nIt added that tens of millions of pieces had been distributed by devolved administrations in the rest of the UK.\nThe items delivered to NHS Trusts in England included:\nOther equipment delivered included body bags, pulse oximeters, swabs, clinical waste containers, cleaning equipment and detergent. \nThis is the vital question that is difficult to answer. \nThere are around 1.58 million NHS staff across the UK in hospitals and the community. All of them will require varying amounts of PPE depending on the type of work they are doing. \nSome bits of kit can only be used once per patient, while others can be used for whole sessions, such as during a ward round visit to many patients. \nAll PPE worn during the highest risk situations - where there will be lots of splatter from infectious droplets - should be single use, unless they can be decontaminated.\nGowns, aprons, gloves and surgical masks should usually be disposed of after a single use or session.\nHowever, when there are shortages, guidelines now say NHS staff can reuse some kit where it is safe to do so, even if it is labelled as single use by the manufacturer.\nThe Health and Safety Executive says it recognises \"some compromise\" is needed when there are extreme shortages of kit and that these \"exceptional circumstances\" do not reflect its standard approach. \nFor example, some gowns could be washed by the hospital laundry and reused, it says. \nIt is easy to see how a member of staff would need to use lots of PPE when following the guidelines.\nNHS Providers, whose members include health trusts, has thanked the fire and police services, vets, local councils, DIY stores and builders' merchants that have donated stocks of gowns and alternatives such as coveralls.\nOn 19 April, the chief executive of NHS Providers Chris Hopson, said: \"No-one in the NHS wanted to be where we now are on gowns, with a significant number of trusts reporting critically low stocks.\"\nThe government acknowledges it will require a \"Herculean logistical effort\" to get the right PPE to those who need it. \nGlobal demand for this equipment is at unprecedented levels and several countries have placed export bans on the sale of PPE.\nMinisters have recruited UK companies, like Burberry, to turn over production lines and start making PPE. \nDeliveries of kit will now happen every day, rather than every few days, says the government.\nThere is a hotline that NHS and social care workers can call to request PPE. \nThe British Medical Association, which represents doctors in the UK, criticised the advice that some single-use PPE could be reused.\n\"If it's being proposed that staff reuse equipment, this must be demonstrably driven by science and the best evidence - rather than availability - and it absolutely cannot compromise the protection of healthcare workers,\" said Dr Rob Harwood, chair of its consultants committee.\nThe Royal College of Nursing says its members can refuse to treat patients as a \"last resort\" if adequate PPE has not been provided."}

The restrictions, which have affected all aspects of society, will continue until at least early May.\nSo, what else has changed? \nThe aim has of the lockdown is to limit the spread of coronavirus, to help the NHS to cope and ultimately reduce the number of deaths from the disease.\nThe government says the number of new cases is stabilising and suggests there is evidence that the public's adherence to the measures is starting to have an impact.\nSir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, said: \"It's not taking off in that sharp uptake, it's not gone sky high. And if anything there might even be some flattening. That is because of what we're all doing with social distancing.\"\nThe way people are using the health service is also changing.\nIn March, the number of people attending A&E dropped whilst the numbers of calls made to 111 - the NHS hotline - reached record highs.\nThe public's use of transport has fallen dramatically, although this trend started before the lockdown measures were announced, as many people started to work from home.\nOverall transport use - road, rail and the Tube in London - fell by 60% between early February and the beginning of April, according to the Department for Transport. \nFootfall at major railway stations across the country has also fallen significantly, data from Network Rail suggests\nIn the week before the lockdown measures were brought in, footfall at Birmingham New Street station stood at over half a million. But that had fallen by 86% at the start of April to 71,230. It's a similar trend for London and Manchester.\nTrips to parks and beaches on 11 April, the third Saturday of lockdown, were 37% lower than normal \nIn England and Wales, crime fell by 28% in the four weeks to 12 April, compared to the same time last year. Home burglary, for example, was down by more than a third, as people spent far more time indoors. \nHowever, incidents of anti-social behaviour rose by 59%.\nThe increase was likely \nMeanwhile, the National Domestic Abuse helpline has seen a 25% increase in calls since the lockdown, the charity Refuge says. \nIt is now receiving hundreds of extra calls for help every week. \nIsolation can make pre-existing abusive behaviour worse, but isn't the reason for it, says Refuge, which runs the helpline.\nOther countries have seen increases, including a 32% rise in reported domestic violence cases in France and a 12% increase in calls to Spain's gender violence hotline, since lockdowns began.\nIn the week before the restrictions started, supermarket sales were 43% higher than the same time last year, as many rushed to stock up amid fear of shortages.\nBut average sales fell by 7.4% over the first fortnight of lockdown according to consultancy Neilsen. \n\"When the country was told not to travel people stopped shopping,\" says Mike Watkins, Nielsen's head of retailer and business insight. \"They had already bought a lot of stuff, and their larders and freezers were full.\"\nHowever, supermarket sales were back up to almost 9% higher than average in the week ending 11 April - perhaps people had eaten all the extra food they had bought.\nSo, what have the most popular items been?\nBeer, wine and spirits sales at supermarkets shot up by a third in the week before the bank holiday, as people stocked up ahead of the long weekend. \nSales of computer games and software shot up by 140%, closely followed by bulbs and seeds. Sales of stamps and of fresh dough and pastry were both up almost 80%.\nHowever, overall sales of non-food items continued to decline, with toiletry purchases down 23%.\nClose to one million people have applied for universal credit since the lockdown began.\nOf these, 473,000 applied in the first eight days, almost as many as applied during the whole of the preceding three weeks, and almost 10 times as many as would apply in an average week.\nUniversal credit is a consolidated monthly payment for those of working-age, replacing a host of previous benefits including income-based jobseeker's allowance, housing benefit, child tax credit and working tax credit.\nWhile there is still considerable pressure on the benefits system, the figures show that the number of claims is now starting to come down, having peaked in the first week of lockdown.\nAir pollution levels in the UK have dropped significantly in the weeks since the country went into lockdown.\nThe level of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) has fallen across the UK, with the daily average down almost 40% on the same period last year.\nNO2, released from car exhausts, is a serious air pollutant.\nSome cities have seen levels fall by more than 60%, including Brighton and Portsmouth, according to \nDaily readings from air quality monitoring stations were compared with the same period last year."}

Critics of the Chinese government have questioned whether the country's official numbers \nChina has now lifted many of the stringent measures it took to bring the disease under control, including a ban on all travel to and from Wuhan.\nThe outbreak was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March. This is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time.\nThe WHO said it took more than three months to reach the first 100,000 confirmed cases worldwide, but it took less than a week for the number to double from 500,000 to a million. It then took two weeks to top two million.\nGovernments across the world have halted flights, locked down towns and cities and urged people to stay at home.\nAlthough slowing of infection rates appears to show the success of social distancing, Italy and Spain remain the worst affected countries after the US.  \nSpain has more than 194,000 confirmed cases - the second highest global figure - while Italy has the second highest death toll of more than 23,000. \nBoth countries have been in lockdown since early March, however some quarantine measures are starting to be relaxed.\nSpanish children, who have been kept indoors at home since 14 March, are expected to be allowed outside on 27 April. \nIn the UK, there have been more than 120,000 confirmed cases and more than 16,000 deaths. \nLike Spain, deaths in the UK grew rapidly at first, doubling faster than every two days. That rate of increase has now slowed, but on Thursday the government said that lockdown restrictions would not be lifted for at least another three weeks.\nGermany's health minister Jens Spahn says the country's month-long lockdown has brought the outbreak there under control - although the number of deaths is still rising.\nThe country will start easing its lockdown from 20 April, with smaller shops allowed to re-open and schools to follow gradually from 4 May. The German government has warned that its economy - Europe's largest - could contract by almost 10% as a result of the crisis.\nOther countries such as Denmark have begun opening up schools for under-11s, while Norway is set to reopen kindergartens on Monday. \nWith more than 735,000 cases, the US has the highest number of confirmed infections in the world. The number of deaths now stands at more than 39,000.\nThe state of New York has more confirmed cases than anywhere else in the world, and there have been more than 13,000 deaths in New York City alone.\nDespite these grim statistics, New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo says cases are starting to level off as the effect of social-distancing measures begins to be seen.\nOn Saturday President Trump announced that state governors have been given three-phase plans to \n\"America wants to be open and Americans want to be open,\" Mr Trump said. \"A national shutdown is not a sustainable long-term solution.\"\nThe outbreak is having a major economic impact, with figures showing the number of people making a new claim for unemployment benefits surging to a record high.\nOn Thursday, the US government said that it had received 20 million claims for unemployment benefits over the preceding four weeks.\nStrict lockdowns were imposed around the world as the outbreak took hold. Confinement measures are now thought to be affecting more than half the global population.\nFrom Argentina to New Zealand and from Saudi Arabia to South Africa, cities were shut down, restricting how often people could leave their homes and for what reason. India told the country's 1.3 billion residents to stay at home.\nIn Paris, authorities banned exercise during the day to reduce the number of people out on the streets.\nSingapore, where authorities were initially praised for containing the virus, has also now imposed a \"semi-lockdown\" as it faces a surge of infections linked to industrial worksites and tightly-packed worker dormitories.\nData on \nThe data shows that while Milan in northern Italy has been locked down for several weeks, many other cities have been restricting movement for a much shorter period. \nWhile movement is also down in the South Korean capital Seoul, the city hasn't ground to a halt like European capitals, despite facing huge numbers of coronavirus cases. This is perhaps an indication of the country's decision to focus on testing and contact tracing, rather than imposing a lockdown.\nIn Sweden, the government has so far avoided strict measures, issuing guidelines rather than rules. And Stockholm's chart shows people are taking the advice - with passenger numbers on subway and commuter trains far below normal levels."}

That was treble the figure for the previous week and double that in the whole of the preceding month.\nIf that number was reflected across all residential and nursing homes, NCF estimated there have been 4,040 coronavirus-related deaths in care homes which are not yet included in official figures.\nMeanwhile, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove has denied reports the government has drawn up a graduated plan to start easing the lockdown within weeks.\nSpeaking to Sophy Ridge on Sky News, he said: \"It is the case that we are looking at all of the evidence, but we have set some tests which need to be passed before we can think of easing restrictions in this lockdown.\" \nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson said \"no decision has been made\" on when schools in England, which were closed on 20 March, will reopen. \nResponding to a \nBut addressing claims in the same paper that ministers had failed to prepare properly for the outbreak, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said there were \"serious questions about the government's immediate response to this pandemic and whether they were too slow to act\".\nThe daily number of UK-wide coronavirus deaths, announced each day by the government, only includes people who died with the virus in hospital in the four nations.\nMinisters have regularly explained that this is because the hospital figures can be quickly collated and released, enabling their experts to analyse trends to help them advise on how the UK is coping with the virus.\nVirus-related deaths in care homes - and elsewhere in the community, such as in hospices or in people's own houses - are measured separately and figures covering England and Wales are announced on a weekly basis by the Office for National Statistics every Tuesday. \nBecause these are based on what doctors write on death certificates - sometimes only issued in the days after the death - there is a two-week lag on collecting this data from the thousands of care homes involved. For that reason, the figures issued last Tuesday only went up to 3 April.\nThat official figure of 217 is \nThe Care Quality Commission (CQC), which holds detailed statistics of care home deaths, has been accused by some in the residential care sector of \"dragging their heels\". \nThe CQC, England's health and social care regulator, said it was working to \"provide more detailed information about how the pandemic is affecting care homes\".\nSeparately, analysis from Care England, which represents large care home providers in England, claims that there have been 7,500 more deaths in care home - from all causes - in the last two weeks than would be expected at this time of year. \nAnd modelling by the health consultancy, Candesic, for the Financial Times, suggested the number of deaths due to the epidemic in UK care homes was at least 6,000.\nThe fact the National Care Forum is saying there's been such a rapid increase in deaths is not surprising - the hospital figures show deaths have been increasing at a similar rate, before beginning to slow more recently.\nBut it is the scale of the deaths which is shocking.\nThey are effectively saying the number of deaths is around six times higher than the Office for National Statistics figures suggest.\nThe NCF has relied on its own staff to say whether they suspect a person has died of coronavirus as well as including the confirmed cases, whereas the official figures rely on cases where doctors have recorded the virus on death certificates.\nSince we have not had widespread testing in care homes so far it is very difficult to really judge the true impact. The government is now promising more testing so it will only be in the coming weeks and months that we will really know.\nVic Rayner, the NCF's executive director, said that as long as residents in care services are omitted from the most widely-quoted statistics, the government will not be able to properly plan how to protect its people or prepare an exit strategy.\nShe said: \"Our current national debate on how to mitigate and exit this crisis is virtually entirely centred on the management of the peak within hospitals. \n\"We are overlooking how this crisis is playing out in other settings, which are there to protect those who are most vulnerable to the impact of the virus. \n\"If we truly believe that every life has value, there can be no meaningful discussions about exit strategies without considering these individuals.\"\nA statement from the Department of Health said: \"Every death from this virus is a tragedy and that is why we are working around the clock to give the social care sector the equipment and support they need to tackle this global pandemic.\"\nThe statement added that it was particularly focusing on providing tests for care workers and their families and ensuring that workers got access to any protective equipment that they required.\nThe government has appointed Lord Deighton, who headed the Organising Committee of the London Olympics, to resolve problems with supplies and distribution of PPE.\nHowever, speaking at Saturday's Downing Street briefing, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick did not dispute the suggestion that the 400,000 gowns in the shipment would only last NHS England around three days.\nIn other developments:\nPlease include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

It is the UK's first \"TikTok house\", a phenomenon already established in the US.\nThe video-makers are proceeding despite their families and others having expressed reservations about the timing of the initiative. \nOne industry expert has also suggested the pandemic will make the effort less lucrative than it might have been.\nThe TikTock-ers have a combined following of more than 14 million people. Their videos currently reach more than 73 million people a week.\nThe short-form video-sharing social media platform was 2019's second most downloaded app after WhatsApp.\nPeople in the UK have been spending a lot more time on TikTok since lockdown and social isolation measures were announced. There was a 23% rise in average viewing time between January and March, according to analysts Sensor Tower.\nThe housemates, \nIn addition to publishing content on their individual accounts, the six stars are also attempting to create a sort of reality show - by posting a narrative of their experience on Bytehouse accounts, which appear on TikTok, YouTube and Instagram.\nThe collective have partnered with \nThe initiative was originally intended to run for three months and include shorter visits by less famous TikTok creators.\nThere are gay and straight couples in the Victorian house, designed to be \u201ca LGBTQ safe space\u201d, but its central London location is being kept secret to prevent fans trying to visit. \nOne post suggests indoor activities, such as learning \"footshakes\" and \"building forts\".\n\"I want to help people through coronavirus by helping them stay inside,\" says Monty. \n\"We're doing daily livestreams and other content, so followers have stuff to interact with while they stay indoors. Seeing some of the reactions and comments is really encouraging.\"\nBut the six also post about brand advertising campaigns and promote music tracks as a team, combining forces and therefore raising earning power.\nFor example, the housemates are paid to play a nightly card game called What do you meme? - to advertise it to their audience. \nIn keeping with the rules, these posts are marked with the hashtag \"ad\".\n\u201cIf you want to create next-generation content for Gen Z, then it's got to come from Gen Z themselves, and that's what we are trying to do here,\u201d says Flow Adepoju, head of innovation at Fanbytes, which owns Bytesized Talent, the company that manages all the housemates.\nFanbytes provides a weekly \"care package\" drop to the house, containing food and essential items.\nYouTube stars in America, such as Team 10 - featuring brothers Logan and Jake Paul - and FaZe Clan, have been coming together in houses for many years now, says Mustafa Mohamed, co-founder of another influencer agency, Yoke Network. \nUK gaming star KSI, meanwhile, lived in The Sidemen House.\nAnd more recently America's biggest TikTok stars have occupied the Hype House.\nThe logic is you cross-pollinate your audiences, Mr Mohamed explains.\n\u201cI worked with a TikTok star called Avani, who was in the Hype House,\u201d he says. \n\u201cI saw her go from a few million to about 15 million followers - and the amount she could earn from her posts rocketed too.\u201d\nThe Fanbytes team had been planning this project since the beginning of the year.\nThey considered cancelling it when it became clear that coronavirus would hit the UK.\n\"I had a frank conversation with our influencers,\" says Timothy Armoo, boss of Fanbytes, \"and every single one of them was still keen on making it happen\".\nSome had conversations with their parents, who voiced their doubts - but they were persuaded when they realised how much the opportunity meant to their children, Armoo says.\nThe TikTok house in Los Angeles known as Fenty Beauty, set up by musician Rihanna to promote her beauty products, took the decision to close in late March.\nA company spokesman described it as \"a precautionary measure due to Covid-19\". The housemates continued to post remotely.\nSome TikTok users have used the comments section on videos posted on the Bytehouse account to question whether it was wise to go ahead with the UK TikTok house. \nA few queried whether it undermined the government's message about social distancing.\nBut, despite reservations about being apart from their families, housemates recognised how important it could be for their social media careers, says Armoo - especially when they factored in the extra traffic that might come from lockdown measures.\nArmoo had already worked with Public Health England's Rise Above project - creating a keepy-uppy football challenge on TikTok to combat anti-social behaviour - so he was well-positioned to bring the collective on board with the project.\nThe housemates have been careful to repeat the \"stay at home\" message to fans.\nOverall, Armoo thinks the gamble of going ahead with the house, despite coronavirus, has paid off.\n\"We've had tens of thousands of comments from teenagers who say our content is brightening their day,\" he says.\nHe won't say how much money the TikTok housemates have made so far.\nBut Tiktok stars with more than two million followers in the UK may earn annual incomes upwards of \u00a325,000, he says, and some can earn much more with long-term brand deals and merchandising opportunities. \nHowever, time in the house during lockdown may not necessarily equal money, warns one digital agency used to working with TikTok talent.\n\"The first things brands cut in a crisis like this is their marketing budget,\" says Alex Jobling, of Burstimo.\nHe believes it is a good time for influencers to grow their following, but not necessarily to pick up new sponsorship deals. \nThe common mission of influencers is to make social media stardom their main source of income and full-time occupation.\nAccording to housemate Monty, one reason for joining the house is to prove that UK TikTok stars can achieve the same status as their American counterparts.\n\"I feel like the UK scene isn't taken as seriously as the US one, so it was nice to take on the opportunity, knowing it was a big deal.\"\nSo far the housemates' content hasn't made a big impact on YouTube or Instagram, where their videos are only getting a few thousand views.\nHowever, on TikTok the housemates have already performed strongly. Their Bytehouse group account has more than 230,000 followers. \nThree of their videos have clocked up more than 800,000 views.\nTheir most popular video to date achieved 1.7 million - by poking fun at the Hype House in America."}

It was a perfectly-judged and moving performance. \nLady Gaga, who was watching at home, summed it up best. \nThe home videos provided a fascinating insight into singers' home recording set-ups. \nSheryl Crow won easily, performing from the professional studio she installed in her backyard barn in Tennessee.\nLet's just look at that room from another angle... \nHow many guitars does one multi-platinum-selling recording artist need?\nBut Crow was one of the lucky ones.

Let's face it, that was never going to happen.\nLopez stayed true to form, conjuring up all the the glitz and glamour we've missed during the lockdown as she performed a syrupy version of Barbara Streisand's People while bathed in the warm glow of a hundred fairy lights.\nIf the lockdown has you feeling low, you're not alone. \n\"It's really strange,\" said pop star Christine And The Queens. \"It's all about screens now and no human contact, and I know it can be draining emotionally.

It was one of the night's most affecting performances.\nNot everyone who took part had a home studio or the ability to play with their regular band, which led to some clever video treatments.\nKeith Urban, who is in lockdown with his wife Nicole Kidman, became his own backing band - with three Keiths all playing simultaneously on a cover of Steve Winwood's Higher Love.\nJohn Legend put together a colourful clip for his single Bigger Love that featured several dancers interacting with one another, despite being in self-isolation (with a glorious twist right at the end).\nEnd of Youtube post  by John Legend\nOne member of the K-Pop band SuperM \nAnd chat show host Jimmy Fallon teamed up with dozens of healthcare workers for a \n\"We can dance, we can dance, everybody's washing their hands,\" the rewritten lyrics declared.\n\"Hi guys, I'm Ellie Goulding and I'm going to play some songs for you,\" said (you guessed it) Ellie Goulding.

Sue Elliott-Nicholls thinks not.  \n\"I'm starting to talk to myself,\" lamented a friend who lives on her own.\n\"What, you mean you don't already?\" I asked her. \"Who do you discuss your problems with, work out who's coming for Christmas, decide whether your bum looks big in those jeans?\"\nMaybe it's because I work a fair bit at home, but I love a good chat with myself. Only lately I've found myself doing it out of doors, when I go for my socially-distanced shop. \nMy conversations are fairly mundane, boring even.\nMe: \"Do you think we need more bananas?\"\nMe again: \nAlso me: \"True, bananas never last long with our lot.\"\nMe: \nMe back: \"Good point, shall we leave them then?\"\nMe (decisively): \nI don't say all of it out loud. Most of it is in my head, but some bits slip out, in a sort of unhinged mutter - until I realise what I'm doing and look sharply around to check no-one heard. Then I cover it up with a low tuneful hum, hoping it looks like that's what I was doing the whole time.\nI hear my husband sometimes, muttering downstairs. I don't listen in, it's private. (Plus he may very likely be moaning about me.)\nMy old mum used to say that the best thing about talking to yourself was that you knew you would get a decent answer. But then she also said it was the first sign of madness.\nIs it? I would beg to differ. I often think my little chats to myself help preserve my sanity.\nBefore the coronavirus lockdown Georgia Maskery didn't talk to herself, but now she's becoming her own motivational speaker, giving herself pep talks.\n\"I always start with\n\"I have to motivate myself to do everything, I have to motivate myself to put pants on in the morning! Although this morning, I was going to go for a run, but I actually talked myself out of it. \nThen it went like this, she told me:\nLook Georgia... are you going to go?\nAre you sure?\nThis doesn't sound like a \"sign of madness\" to me, this sounds like a very healthy coping strategy.\n\"I think also it makes you feel like you've got a crowded house, when it's not, it's just the voices in your head,\" says Georgia. \"It has actually become the new normal, which is really crazy. I miss my mates, I can talk to them on Zoom but I miss talking in real life so I've become my own mate.\"\nWelcome to my world Georgia, it's a wonderful place. Isn't it, Sue?\nWhen I'm working on my own, I become like my own work colleague - we're partners really. Sue is invaluable when we're at work together: we bang out ideas, discuss how to word difficult emails, sometimes we have a little gossip at the water cooler (kitchen sink), and it's nice because she comes out with me later, even helps me decide what to wear. God, I love Sue. \nFrankie has become her own new best friend. Before the lockdown, she only used to talk to herself if she was upset, or making stupid decisions.\n\"I think it's like my guardian angel when it comes to boys,\" Frankie says. \"If he's not behaving in the best way, I'll be in the toilet, saying: 'Oh come on mate, you know he's no good!'\"\nBut talking to yourself in these situations is kind of accepted isn't it? They do it in movies, cute and kooky (but sane) characters do it. It's when you start muttering to yourself about daily goings on that it feels a little weirder.\nAnd since social isolation Frankie, starved of her friends and her job, has started doing this when she puts her make-up on in the morning. \"I'll just put a bit of brown here, this is my mascara, and then I line my lips with this lipliner, I'm going to put these little two dots here and here, and then I smudge it, here and here,\" she'll mutter.\n\"And then I'm like - \nFrankie's worried about turning into her mum, who talks to herself, too.\n\"I can see her zoning out and then she starts talking,\" she says. \"I realise that is what awaits me.\" \nAs the lockdown has dragged on, Georgia has also started to get on her own nerves. \n\"I don't like my pep talks sometimes,\" she says.\nSo, of course, she talks to herself about it.\n\"No actually, you're being annoying, because I want to wallow lazily and now you're making me feel like I'm not doing well enough,\" she tells herself.  \nGeorgia is sitting with her hand to her head and her eyes scrunched up as she tells me this on FaceTime, cringing at herself. \n\"Before, when I was always out of the house, my inner monologue was still going but it wouldn't slip out - whereas now, that barrier has gone,\" she says.\nGeorgia and Frankie are fairly new to the concept of talking to themselves, but ask any freelancer who spends a lot of time working alone at home, and they'll tell you they're old hands.\nKate Walsh has spoken to herself for as long as she can remember.\n\"I can get a little bit lonely so I try to be a friend to myself,\" she says.\nSometimes, she even makes up a tune. \nI suspect most people who have always worked at home will recognise that straight away.\n\"Sometimes I'm not sure if it's happening inside or outside of my head,\" says Kate. \n\"Because you spend so much time on your own, your inner dialogue becomes external, so you might say in a shop: \nKate believes talking to yourself is a really good way of getting through hard times. She found it a useful coping strategy when, a few years ago, after a traffic accident and an MRSA infection, she had to spend three months in a hospital room by herself. \n\"I'd say out loud: 'This will pass, this isn't that bad.' And just hearing those words helped me through. When you speak out loud you hear the words, whereas if it stays inside your head you don't hear it so well. If it comes out of my mouth it becomes more tangible in my mind.\"\nAnd now we're stuck indoors, we could all do with a bit of reassurance.\n\"There's a subtle pervading atmosphere of tension around at the moment,\" says Kate. \"People have to let out steam, it's a legitimate way of exorcising the stress.\" \nI agree. It definitely helps.\nMy counsellor once told me to talk to my inner child, and it was good, until my mum died and my friends told me I should talk to her. I ended up talking to both of them - and myself.\nThere is much talk of how aspects of social distancing might improve life in the future. We may come out of this having got to know our kids better, met previously unknown neighbours on WhatsApp groups, and become fitter on our daily runs. \nI think this could also be the perfect opportunity to come out, to boldly chat to ourselves with not a care about who might hear us and what they might think. I think that's a great idea. In fact, I'm going to have a cup of tea and discuss it now, with Sue.\nIt's becoming normal for grown-up children to spend years at home even after starting work, because of the mismatch between salaries and rents. Sue Elliott-Nicholls and her son, Morgan, agree that it can be a nightmare. "}

The first is the increased risk of catching Covid-19 - living in more densely populated areas in overcrowded housing will be important risk factors. The second is the risk of adverse outcomes: diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease have all been found to be risk factors, and these are much more common in our South Asian patients.\nI know from my work in epidemics in Africa that where there is fear and panic, and patients become isolated from their families, it doesn't take long for rumours and fake news stories to start circulating. \nIn the Covid pandemic, smartphones and social media have connected families who are separated because of the risk of infection - but they've also helped generate a blizzard of dangerous fake news. In Bradford there are online reports that non-white patients admitted to the hospital are being left to die. Anonymous posts are shared thousands of times. \nHere's one, which is totally false: \"Please don't show my details. I work for BRI hospital trust. I am begging all the \nThe effect of this kind of thing is being felt in the hospital, where we have noticed that some patients are scared to be admitted.\n\"I've had patients who want to self-discharge because they think we're trying to kill them. I've had a patient a couple of weeks ago, who wanted to self-discharge because her family was messaging her telling her that if she dies in our care, we won't tell them and we'll just burn her body. These are the things that are being spread around,\" a nurse, Sophie Bryant-Miles, tells me.\nSophie complained to Facebook about a group that she says was posting pictures of NHS staff - naming them, and accusing them of leaving people to die - but often such groups are able to continue operating under a different name, she says.\nWard manager Jennie Marshall-Hamad notes that the danger of such rumours is that they deter sick people from seeking medical help \"and they will just die outside alone\".\nAnd in fact in Bradford we have figures that suggest death rates are going up, outside the hospital. \nProf John Wright, a medical doctor and epidemiologist, is head of the Bradford Institute for Health Research. He has looked after patients in epidemics all over the world, including outbreaks of cholera, HIV and ebola in sub-Saharan Africa. In this diary he is reporting for the BBC on how the Bradford Royal Infirmary is coping with Covid-19.\nRead other recent posts: \nMessages like the WhatsApp example above are in wide circulation and some have been sent to community workers like Ali Jan Haider, director of the Keeping Well At Home project in Bradford. \n\"I was receiving a number of WhatsApp messages that are quite alarming, because their tone was quite clear in the way they were criticising hospitals,\" he says.\n\"The overall message was saying to local people 'don't send your loved ones to hospital because if you do it, chances are they will not return home alive'. \n\"And some of the so-called accounts of what's really going on create suspicion - they are peppered with emotions, and quite a strong level of unhappiness about the way that their relatives have been treated by staff within the hospitals.\"\nHe says that some of these highly critical messages have come from influential people in the Muslim community, and even from an imam in the south of England. If someone already has misgivings about their local hospital this kind of messaging will \"certainly make them think twice\", he says.\nIt's natural for people to want to share any concerns they may have on WhatsApp or on Facebook, Ali Jan Haider concedes, but these messages worry him. \n\"My fear is, and my concern is, that quite a few of them could be unfounded, and I'm not even sure if they're authentic. They could be quite malicious or they could be there just to create panic and trepidation at a time when people are feeling very vulnerable,\" he says.\nSome Asian doctors and nurses at Bradford Royal Infirmary are so worried about fake news scaring away people in their own community who need to be in hospital that they've started a counter-offensive, making short videos of themselves and their patients and posting them online.\nEnd of Youtube post  by karen dawber\nAli Jan Haider has been spreading the same reassuring message, though he is also keen to point out that most of the South Asian community in Bradford has no doubt about the good intentions of medical staff. \n\"The local community has been absolutely amazing in the way that it's been supporting the NHS staff in Bradford,\" he says. \"We've had donations from parts of Bradford where we have communities that live on the edge of poverty, but they have dug deep, and they've been immensely supportive.\"\nSo the false news is coming from strange and isolated voices in the community, but it's still troubling, and the support of community leaders is very important.\nThe president of the Bradford Council of Mosques, Zulfi Karim, has seen fake news of a different kind. In an earlier diary I pointed out that \n\"I have various concerns around the rise of Islamophobia and claims that this is a Muslim thing, that Muslims congregate more and that Ramadan is around the corner,\" he says.\n\"That is the message that's out there, and I think that's rubbish. I do think that Ramadan, this year, will be in isolation. I don't think there will be any public events. So I think there is a lot of fake news, which is really, really concerning for all of us.\"\nHe also worries about Islamophobic rhetoric arising from the news that members of the BAME community are more at risk of dying from Covid-19. The emphasis now should simply be on saving lives, supporting the NHS and making sure that everyone is getting fair and equal treatment, he says. But afterwards he would like to see more research to establish whether the reports are true, and investment to tackle the problem if they are.\nFollow "}

While many countries would struggle to cope with a serious spread of Covid-19, Haiti might never recover from one. \nThe reality inside Haiti's intensive care units is even bleaker than that number - taken from a 2019 study - suggests. According to Stephan Dragon, a respiratory therapist in the capital, Port-au-Prince, the true number of ventilators is actually closer to 40, and maybe 20 of those aren't working.\n\"We also have a very, very limited group of doctors who know how to operate them,\" Mr Dragon said.\nThe Haitian government has recently attempted to buy much-needed equipment - from ventilators to PPE, including tens of thousands of facemasks from Cuba - but Haitian healthcare practitioners like Mr Dragon fear it is too little, too late.\n\"To tell you the truth, we are not prepared at all,\" he said.\nSo far, this small impoverished nation has only registered three deaths from the virus and 40 confirmed cases, but many more cases may be going unreported, especially in remote areas. \nLevels of testing are low and enforcement of social distancing is patchy at best. The Haitian population also suffers high levels of diabetes and other health conditions, and a major coronavirus outbreak would place an unbearable strain on a collapsing healthcare system.\nHaiti's ability to respond is confounded by its economic straits. Around 60% of Haitians live below the poverty line and many face a stark choice: either go about your daily business and run the risk of contracting COVID-19, or stay indoors, as the government advises, and be unable to put food on the table.\nIt is little wonder that so many are taking their chances.\nThat is the dilemma facing Jean Raymond and his family. He lives in Furcy, a mountainous village outside of Port-au-Prince where most families scratch a meagre living from land.\nJean Raymond, however, isn't a farmer but a motorbike taxi driver, part of Haiti's vast informal economy. Rremaining indoors is not an option if he is to feed his wife and two young children, he said.\n\"It's impossible for me to not leave the house,\" he said. \"If I'm obligated to stay in my home, what would we eat?\"\nJean Raymond's wife, Lucienne, criticised the government for failing to show enough support in the village. \"We want to respect the rules but we can't,\" she said. \"I see what governments are doing in other countries, but here they aren't doing anything.\"\nIn the absence of the state, it has fallen to local grassroots organisations to carry out basic but vital tasks. Clean water is a precious commodity in Furcy - indeed it is a scarce resource across Haiti - and one environmentalist group called Ekoloji pou Ayiti has prepared dozens of water canisters to make handwashing stations in some of the neediest communities.\nGiven the deep distrust of NGOs in Haiti, it was crucial to \"make sure the community leaders were part of the project,\" said Max Faublas, co-founder of Ekoloji pou Ayiti.\nAs well as building 88 water stations, the group showed people how to make their own hand-sanitiser using vinegar. They have also tried to tackle widespread misinformation with a public education campaign on the importance of wearing a facemask, avoiding handshakes and disinfecting shoes and clothes.\nStill, although members of the community appreciate the rules in theory, putting them into practice can be hard. For example, Jean Raymond and his family live with his parents - six people in a tiny home, all living on top of each other.\nAnd if social distancing is difficult in rural Furcy, it is almost out of the question for many in Haiti's sprawling, densely-populated shantytowns. \nIn Port-au-Prince, market days have been cut back, creating further demand for basic food supplies. Some are growing desperate. There have been chaotic scenes outside food distribution points and trucks selling bread. The government has been distributing food parcels to the most vulnerable households but many are angry at having to jostle and compete in a crowd for food.\n\"The way they are distributing food is humiliating,\" one resident, Mesmin Louigene, told the Reuters news agency. \"People do not respect social distancing. The government should organise it better. I'm very concerned at the sanitary conditions, it's very worrying.\"\nThat the looming healthcare crisis is a great threat to Haiti is of little surprise - that is true of most of Latin America and the Caribbean. What's especially deadly in the region's poorest country though is the combination of the pandemic and a crippling economic crisis. In a bid to stave off further economic ruin, the Prime Minister Joseph Jouthe said this week the country's textile factories would re-open later this month, but the move runs contrary to advice from the Pan American Health Organisation to keep lockdown restrictions in place.\nIn Furcy, Jean Raymond was under no illusions about what a major COVID-19 outbreak would mean to his village.\n\"If Coronavirus comes into my community, it would be a disaster. We don't have a hospital or even a good road. The conditions we live in\u2026\" his voice trailed off. \n\"There's no way. We will all die if coronavirus comes here.\""}

It was really quiet and then suddenly a mad rush. The collapse came in a day,\" says Laura And\u00fajar, a 37-year-old emergency nurse.\nSpain has seen more than 20,000 deaths and the Madrid region is at the heart of it: a capital city blighted by this virus.\nThis city has seen 7,000 deaths, more than other European capitals.\nThe contagion spread at a remarkable rate through the densely populated city and its cluster of suburbs. \nThe real death toll could be considerably higher as Madrid's regional government has revealed only 800 of 4,260 care home residents suspected of dying from Covid-19 were tested.\nThe first local infection is believed to have been detected on 27 February. By 15 March, there were 3,544 confirmed cases.\nAt the peak on 31 March, 3,419 new cases were reported here on a single day.\n\"What followed was two weeks of madness,\" says Laura And\u00fajar. \nAnother emergency department nurse, Eugenia Cuesta, is no stranger to epidemics. She has dealt with cholera in Haiti and Ebola in Sierra Leone as a Red Cross volunteer.\n\"We collapsed. On a normal bad winter flu day you might get 100 people waiting. We had 220 from Covid-19, and people ended up sleeping in corridors,\" she remembers.\nAnd in this outbreak they were not prepared for the onslaught. \"Five days in, I got a cough and tested positive.\"\n\"The protective equipment arrived late and is still insufficient. I avoided cholera and Ebola infection, and I got this straight away,\" she says. When she came back at the end of March she found \"the same degree of disorganisation\".\nHer colleagues had become used to chaos and were too exhausted to consider working in other ways, she believes.\nDoctors at the hospital admit they had a lot to learn, and fast.\n\"At the start, just as the population is very nervous about coronavirus, so were we as doctors,\" admits Dr Trujillo, a 35-year-old Mexican kidney and intensive care specialist who accepts he is not an expert in contagious disease.\n\"But as days go by and medical publications start coming out, we have learned a lot. The hospital committee meets every day to discuss different treatments and what to look out for in analysis,\" he adds.\nHealth workers' unions have accused hospital authorities of failing to provide the best personal protective equipment (PPE) for doctors and nurses.\nThis could be the main reason why Spain has one of the largest known levels of infection among health professionals in the world, with more than 27,500 catching Covid-19. \n12 de Octubre hospital declined to comment on the issues raised in this article, but staff paint a mixed picture of the availability of PPE.\nEnrique Morales, a 52-year-old kidney specialist, says he had full use of plastic protective equipment when visiting Covid-19 patients, but for other work has only had a paper gown as protection. \n\"The shortages we had anyway have been brutally exposed,\" he told the BBC.\nFrom the second week of the crisis, PPE became scarce, says Dr Trujillo. Respirator masks ran out so they had to use two surgical masks as an alternative. \"We doctors can stand back from patients, so it's more important for nurses.\"\nBecause there was not enough protective equipment, nurses said they had to overuse what they had, sometimes wearing it for an entire shift.\nEugenia Cuesta says the risks are far too high.\n\"The mortality rate is nothing like Ebola, say, so we end up accepting the lack of security,\" she says.\nLike her colleague, Laura And\u00fajar also caught coronavirus. First came diarrhoea before the more typical fever, aching limbs and loss of taste and smell. \nShe believes they should all have been screened to prevent contagion among the hospital team.\nDr Morales needed hospital treatment after catching Covid-19 and agrees failure to test health workers whether they had symptoms or not has put the system under greater pressure. \nUnder Spain's lockdown laws hospital patients cannot have visitors, and for some patients that feeling of absolute solitude has aggravated the illness.\n\"You're like a plague victim, with no visits allowed,\" says Dr Morales, \"stuck between four walls and just the occasional health worker saluting you from afar.\" \nFor all the health workers, the crisis has posed impossible dilemmas.\nNurse Cuesta speaks of separating elderly couples when one tests positive and the other has to go home alone. \nFor Dr Morales it is the decision of who gets the intensive care bed, and who does not.\n\"If you have two 35-year-olds, and one has renal problems, you give the place to the one without renal problems,\" says Dr Morales. Some of his kidney patients would have had a good chance of survival but died, he believes.\nLaura And\u00fajar leaves work crying every day at the thought of people dying alone. \n\"There was an old lady, she was so frightened and struggling to breathe,\" says Laura And\u00fajar. \"I thought the most important thing I could do was to stay there and hold her hand for five minutes.\"\n\"In my mask and goggles, she couldn't see my mouth but I smiled with my eyes. She actually got better.\" \nThat, of course, is not always the case and informing relatives is made all the harder by a lack of physical proximity to the family.\n\"When things are going badly with a patient, we would usually talk several times a day with a family,\" explains intensive care doctor Rub\u00e9n Viejo. Trained at 12 de Octubre, he now works at another hospital.\nBeing there prepares both family and doctor for any negative news but now relatives miss that entirely. \n\"They don't even know exactly where the patient is, whether they are dressed properly and if they are clean. And they cannot say goodbye.\n\"It's unlike anything we've seen before. The immune system goes haywire and there is major swelling in the lungs, but also clots of blood appear in the lungs and in blood vessels elsewhere that can cause organ failure.\" \nThings have begun to improve at the hospital. \nResults are getting better as doctors learn about the illness and pressure on resources eases as the rate of new infections in Madrid drops to less than 2% a day.\n\"In bad times, people help out,\" says Ms And\u00fajar. \"They are creating neighbourly networks and this is supplying things we need. Well done to so many people for staying at home; the infernal period is now over.\"\n\"We hear the applause and head towards the windows. It recharges us with energy. We all have recordings of it on our phones,\" says Dr Viejo.\nBut not everyone believes it will last. \n\"Today we get applause at 8pm every evening, but I am not sure we will get the same support when we demonstrate for better conditions and support for public health,\" warns Eugenia Cuesta. \"People forget quickly.\" "}

The BBC's Mary Harper was a friend of his.\nWhenever Hudeidi played his oud, it was impossible to keep still. \nBodies swayed, hands clapped and fingers snapped. His music was transporting and somehow possessed your whole being.\nBut there was even more to Hudeidi, or the \"king of oud\" as he was popularly known, than his sublime music. \nHe was a life force; warm, generous, humble and funny. \nFrom the moment I met him, I felt I was part of his family.\nI was not the only one. He welcomed everybody to his London home, preparing strong Yemeni coffee and offering a bed to anyone who needed it. \nIt was an informal music school, with people coming from all over the world to learn from the maestro. \nOne student was a Somali woman in her 60s who had never before been allowed to learn music. Another was a bus driver.\nHudeidi was born in the Somali port city of Berbera in 1928. He grew up across the Gulf of Aden in Yemen and was attracted to music from a young age.\n\"Whenever I saw the police band playing drums, I would run after them, imagining I was beating those instruments. I would get carried away, losing the sense of time, until a member of the family would find me and take me home,\" he once said.\nWhen Hudeidi was 14 years old, his father took him to a party in Aden. An oud was being played and Hudeidi fell in love. \nHe described his affection for the rounded wooden instrument as an illness; whenever he saw one, he just had to pick it up and play.\nIt was around this time that Hudeidi met the legendary Somali composer and oud player, Abdullahi Qarshe. \n\"One day I began to touch and caress his oud. Qarshe noticed this immediately and asked me what kind of things my father bought me to take to school. \n\"I said: 'Books and pencils'. Qarshe said that was fine but that he should also buy me a basic oud.\"\nHudeidi learned quickly and shone as a player, winning prizes at carnivals and making a name for himself. He moved back to Somaliland, then on to Djibouti where he was booted out by the French colonisers for singing political songs. \nHe went back home, where he also got in trouble with the authorities. At one time they tried to ban his music, describing it as the \"devil's work\". \nThe musician once wrote a letter to the head of the National Security Service asking: \"Where is that large vessel brimming with fresh milk and the lush grass they had promised?\" \nHe said this angered the man, who \"sent a stern word to me to the effect that if I did not stop such mischief, they would see to it that my high reputation among Somalis would be ruined\".\nHis popularity made other performers jealous. He described how some envious musicians poured ghee into his oud, which led him to compose the verse:\nHudeidi eventually settled in London but travelled all over the world, delighting people with his musical mastery. Age was no issue. He was still playing concerts in his 90s.\nEnd of Youtube post  by Aar Maanta\nDespite his exalted status, the 'king of oud' never liked making a fuss. \nI remember a prize-giving ceremony in London where he was being presented with a lifetime achievement award. It was a black-tie event and Hudeidi's niece brought a bow tie for him to wear, but he was having none of it. \nIn the end, we had an amusing tussle with him as we tried to persuade him to wear it, at least for going up to the podium.\nHe also had a cross-generational appeal. \nI went to one of his concerts in the basement of a small bookshop in London. \nSomehow, the famous young Somali musician Aar Maanta got wind he was playing there. He rushed from home with his oud, ran down the stairs to the crowded room, grabbed a chair and started playing with Hudeidi, both men grinning and laughing as they worked their magic.\nSultan Ali Shire is Hudeidi's official biographer. He was also a long-time student of his and describes Hudeidi as \"the man who sowed the seeds of Somali music as it is today and the best father anyone could have\". \nAnother of his students - and one who sometimes played in public with him - is author Nadifa Mohamed, who was like a daughter to Hudeidi. \n\"He was everything to me,\" she says. \"He started off as a teacher of music, but taught me history, culture and language too. Music poured out of him; even in his kitchen he would start drumming his fingers on the worktops.\"\nHudeidi said it was not always possible to separate music from politics, especially during times of hardship, like the dictatorship of long-serving former President Siad Barre, or the long years of conflict, drought and other difficulties.\n\"He was a patriot with grounded civic principles,\" says the US-based Somali professor Ahmed Samatar. \"An artistic pioneer with bottomless stamina. He gave us over 70 years of high-octane performances.\"\nMohamed says Hudeidi was \"always a rebel, supporting people's right to be individuals\".\nThis spirit did not sit well with everybody, including his parents, who were never happy with his musical career, right from the time he was a child. \n\"We were at war with each other,\" said Hudeidi. \"Kick and punch became the medium of our encounters. It was as if their boy had decided to destroy his life before it even bloomed.\"\nMany of Hudeidi's songs have become part of Somalis' DNA, no matter where they come from, no matter which clan they belong to. \nHis favourite song was one he wrote for his brother, Uur Hooyo or Mother's Womb:\nHe saw music and his teaching as a way of trying to maintain cultural continuity despite the divisions caused by 30 years of conflict. \n\"The hearts of Somali musicians are heavy with sorrow that comes from our broken common history and thus the loss of our rich cultural heritage,\" he said.\nHe also saw music as a way of making sense of things. \n\"The artistic imagination not only sharpens our view of the world. It also presents us with ways of understanding, speaking about, dreaming about and conducting our lives.\""}

Or worse - what if you broke up just before the order to stay at home, and are now awkwardly stuck under the same roof? \nIf you're lucky enough to work from home, how do you deal with difficult children - or a boss who likes to micromanage you remotely?\nWhat if you still have to go in to work - and your boss won't let you wear a mask?\nWhat if your parents are driving you crazy?\nOr what if you just feel really lonely?\nFor decades, advice columnists - or \"agony aunts\" - have been the go-to place for people wanting to ask for advice anonymously. Now, the crisis means some columnists are getting more queries - and the questions have become more serious and urgent. \n\"The outbreak has dramatically changed the type of mail I'm getting,\" says Alison Green, who runs the popular Ask A Manager advice column. \"About 90% of them are now related to the outbreak.\"\nHarriette Cole, who writes the syndicated column Sense and Sensitivity, says \"there is no relationship today that isn't somehow affected\".\nShe has had questions ranging from dealing with over-friendly neighbours who won't social distance, to staying in touch with elderly parents who don't know how to use smart phones, to \nFrankly, this is a time when we could all use some advice and support - so we spoke to some of the US's favourite agony aunts and uncles, to find out what problems are bothering their readers the most - and what advice they have.\nMs Green says that, prior to the outbreak, most of her reader questions were about awkward interactions. \n\"There was a lot of inter-personal stuff - like 'my co-worker is really annoying', or 'I'm allergic to my boss' perfume'. I have almost none of those questions now - because that stuff goes away if you're not physically at work with people, and people's priorities are different now.\"\nInstead, her readers are particularly worried about job security - and \nIt's a similar situation for Quentin Fottrell, who runs The Moneyist, an advice column on the finance media site Marketwatch.\nInstead of personal finance queries, he says the \"lion's share\" of questions are now about workplace safety - such as one from a grocery store worker who was in close proximity to customers, but \n\"Service workers in essential industries are really at the coal face,\" Mr Fottrell says. \"People are just grappling with bosses who don't understand the pandemic.\" \nSo what should you do if your workplace is unsafe?\n\"It's really hard, but if your employer is making decisions that jeopardise your health, you can try to push back as a group, because there's safety in numbers,\" says Ms Green.  \n\"Depending on the situation, it might also be something you can report to the state authorities.\"\nOne question that struck Mr Fottrell came from someone who had\nHis advice? That paying would be a \"decent gesture\" if they could afford it. Since service staff have been hit particularly hard by the outbreak, he also suggests people tip 5% more than usual.\n\"I feel like it's the lower paid workers who are really taking the brunt of this virus through their workplaces - when I go to the supermarket, I always say 'thank you for working today'.\"\nAnother common theme Ms Green has seen is about remote working - with managers expecting employees to work around the clock, or \n\"Managers are suddenly managing everyone remotely - and some don't know how to - so they micromanage, or want multiple check-ins every day. I've heard from people whose managers wanted them to stay on video all day long\" to prove they're working, Ms Green says. \nFor people with anxious bosses, Ms Green suggests that you offer to send them information at the start of each day about what you're working on, and try to explain that having several check-in meetings daily could actually make you less productive. \nMeanwhile, she tells managers that it's in their own interests to be supportive right now - and understanding of employees who may be less productive than usual. \"People have long memories... If they see you making life harder for your employees - they may not leave right away, but they will eventually.\"\nRelationship advice columnists have also seen a drastic change. \nHarris O'Malley runs the Dr Nerdlove column - which he describes as giving \"dating advice to geeks of all stripes\".\nPreviously, many questions were from readers who felt they were unattractive or socially awkward. Thanks to social distancing, these questions have fallen away - partly, he believes, because \"a lot of my audience feel more secure communicating over text or internet than in person\".\nInstead, the outbreak has \"changed the mechanics\" of dating - and he now has to coach people on how to have good online dates. \n\"I'm having to tell people about how to connect on a more mental or emotional level - how to keep relationships vibrant when you can't fall back on the easy outs. \n\"When you're not able to meet up in person, you can't say 'let's have this casual relationship and see if it goes anywhere' - people are now finding they have to approach relationships with thought, care and attention.\"\nDan Savage, who runs the popular Savage Love column and podcast, says over 80% of the queries he gets are now coronavirus-related - and the outbreak has forced him to change his advice as \"the very premise of many sex and dating questions has been exploded\" by the outbreak. \nPreviously, he often advocated for non-monogamous and open relationships. Now, he finds himself \nHe also gets questions about \"sexting\".\n\"It's funny how this crisis has mainstreamed online sex - even a government health department is now telling people that \nBeyond online sex, Dan Savage says many readers \"find being forced to spend every moment with their partner is exposing cracks in their relationship\".\nIt's important that couples \"carve out time alone\" even when they are under the same roof, he says. \"We interpret someone wanting 'alone time' as rejection, but studies show one predictor of long-term success in a couple is the ability to spend time apart.\"\nSome of the most memorable questions he received came from \nIn those cases, he has suggested that readers stay put where possible, and \"acknowledge the awkwardness\". \nIn the case of the woman who wanted to leave her husband, he suggested signalling some flexibility for now - even if her mind's made up - to make her temporary living situation more bearable for them both. \nAll the relationship advice columnists we spoke to said they received more questions from \nMr O'Malley says clients \"who are lonely and want to date\" have asked him whether they can flirt with people they see in public places. \"I've had to tell them: no, you really can't - it's kind of irresponsible to do so right now.\"\nMs Cole has received a lot of what she describes as \n\"Normally by now they would be [meeting] each other. Now all they have is social media,\" she says. Her advice? To try doing things the old-school way, by \"literally talking on the phone\", because \"engaging in lengthier conversations will help you to get to know each other better\". \nMr Savage urges single readers not to assume that couples are happier. \"Happiness is something we create for ourselves. We all need to build lives that are rich, as individuals, because there will be times in all our lives when we're un-partnered. Work on getting happy now - you can work on getting partnered later.\" \nJohn Paul Brammer writes the \u00a1Hola Papi! column, which advises on LGBT issues - particularly for the Latino community. \nHe says he has seen a dramatic jump in the number of reader queries - and is \"getting a lot of letters from people who've found they've had to re-closet themselves\" during the pandemic.\nSome of his readers are out to their friends but not their parents, while others may be out, but still \"feel more comfortable expressing their full selves outside their homes\".\n\"Now that a lot of people find themselves at home with their parents 24/7, a lot of anxiety returns - they feel re-closeted or like they're losing who they are.\"\nHis advice is to remember that \"this is temporary, and you're still you\", and to try and communicate your feelings with a supportive family member or friends.\nHe also urges people to reach out to others - \"everyone wants to be connected right now\u2026 pain is what bonds people together\".\nThese may be unprecedented times - but coronavirus isn't the first crisis the world has faced.\nMs Green started the Ask a Manager column in 2007 - shortly before the recession hit - and remembers that \"for years, my mail was very depressing\". \nSimilarly, Mr Savage began his column in 1991, and says his early column was dominated by questions from readers anxious about the HIV/Aids crisis.\nHe emphasises that things won't always be like this. \"It's terrifying, I'm scared, but we will come through this\u2026 The crisis is highlighting a lot of social injustices, and hopefully that will stiffen our resolve to do something about it after the crisis ends.\" \nMeanwhile, Mr Fottrell says \"one of the most valuable functions of an advice column is it shows people who haven't written in\" that others are experiencing similar problems. \n\"You are not alone. We always think our situations are unique - and while we are unique as people, if you're experiencing something, you can be sure many others are too.\" \nAnd finally - \nMr O'Malley recalls a recent question submitted to the Dr Nerdlove column, where a reader was \"worried about the size and appearance of his genitalia\".\n\"I never thought I'd say this - but I really appreciated a question that wasn't about Covid-19!\""}

Robots are also being used to perform roles workers cannot do at home.\nWalmart, America's biggest retailer, is using robots to scrub its floors.\nRobots in South Korea have been used to measure temperatures and distribute hand sanitiser.\nWith health experts warning some social distancing measures may need to be in place through 2021, robot workers may be in greater demand.\nCompanies that make cleaning and sanitising products have seen demand soar. \nUVD Robots, the Danish manufacture of ultraviolet-light-disinfection robots, shipped hundreds of its machines to hospitals in China and Europe.\nGroceries and restaurants offering takeaway are using these machines more too.\nExperts say as more businesses re-open we can expect to see further adoption of this technology - you may see robots cleaning your schools or offices. \n\"Customers now care more about their safety and the safety and health of workers,\" says Blake Morgan, author of The Customer of the Future.\n \"Moves towards automation can keep them all healthier and customers will reward companies that do this.\" \nThere are still limitations. Ms Morgan points out that automated checkouts at groceries should reduce human interactions but because many systems don't work well or break easily customers avoid them and go to human cashiers instead. \nFood service is another area where the use of robots is likely to increase because of health concerns.\nFast-food chains like McDonald's have been testing robots as cooks and servers.\nIn warehouses, like those operated by Amazon and Walmart, robots were already used to improve efficiency. The Covid-19 outbreak has both companies looking to increase the use of robots for sorting, shipping and packing. \nThis may reduce the number of complaints by warehouse workers who say they cannot social-distance from their colleagues under the current conditions. But, according to technology experts, it would put some of them out of work. \nOnce a company has invested in replacing a worker with a robot it's unlikely the firm will ever rehire for that role. Robots are more expensive to create and integrate into businesses but once they are up and running, robots are typically cheaper than human workers.\nAccording to the futurist Martin Ford, using robots in the post Covid-19 world also presents some marketing advantages.\n\"People will prefer to go to a place that has fewer workers and more machines because they feel they can lower overall risk,\" he explains\nWhat about service roles where a person is needed to offer a lesson or guideline?\nArtificial intelligence is being developed that can replace school tutors, fitness trainers and financial advisers.\nBig tech companies are expanding the use of artificial intelligence. Both Facebook and Google are relying on AI to remove more inappropriate posts since the companies' human content moderators can't review certain things from home. \nRobot sceptics had believed humans would have an edge in those jobs. That could be changing as lockdowns have  made humans more comfortable with the idea of connecting remotely. The instructor or adviser on the screen doesn't need to be a real person, it just needs to think and act like one.\nA 2017 report by global consultants McKinsey predicted a third of workers in the US would be replaced by automation and robots by 2030. But events like pandemics have the potential to change all the timelines and experts say it's really up to humans to decide how they want to integrate this technology in the world."}

What will happen to the money?\nHaving recently been treated for a broken hip and skin cancer, Capt Tom was inspired to walk the 2.5km (1.6 miles) around his home garden with the aid of a frame to raise money for NHS Charities Together.\nCapt Tom himself said he set about raising the money \"for the sake of the nurses and the NHS we have, because they are doing such a magnificent job\".\nThe umbrella organisation supports more than 140 member health service charities, which are typically linked to specific hospitals or NHS trusts.\nMany of the funds donated to NHS Charities Together are then disseminated to charities to use at a local level - and that's where the kind of money raised by Capt Tom will be spent.\nDonations since the pandemic started have been used to help set up wellbeing spaces in hospitals. These include sleep pods, reclining chairs and so-called \"wobble rooms\" - areas where staff have a safe space to release emotions after a traumatic experience, such as losing a patient.\nWellbeing packs including everyday items such as porridge, tea or hand cream have also been given to staff, which one charity member said was \"like a hug in a box\".\nThe money has also helped pay for electronic tablets that allow patients who are in isolation in hospital to have contact with their friends and family.\nIn the long term, the funds will be used in planning to allow people to leave hospital quicker and safely, and also provide mental health support for staff and volunteers involved in dealing with the pandemic.\nChairman Ian Lush said: \"It's extraordinary to see the amount of money and the outpouring of goodwill towards the NHS and towards all the NHS charities, who will take good care with the money that he's raising.\"\nWhen Capt Tom finished his 100th lap live on BBC Breakfast, his JustGiving fundraising page temporarily crashed.\nHis current total is the largest raised in a single campaign on the site, and the company itself has become one of more than 900,000 donors, giving \u00a3100,000.\nIn March 2019 the website abolished its 5% mandatory platform fee from donations, replacing it instead with a voluntary contribution model.\nWhen donating, people are asked if they would like to make a contribution, starting at 10%, and they must opt out of this amount if they do not wish to pay it.\nIn a statement a spokeswoman said: \"This model provides donors with choice and transparency, as well as allowing JustGiving to maintain the technology that keeps our site running 24/7, provide top-notch customer service and give everyone the best experience on JustGiving.\"\nShe added that 97% of all monies raised would go to NHS Charities Together, as with any other fundraiser on the donation site.\nFor an online card transaction paid in pounds on JustGiving, 1.9% on each donation plus 20p is deducted. Other currencies are subject to a 2.9% plus 20p deduction.\nA significant proportion of this is understood to go to card companies but JustGiving also receives a proportion, which is used towards operating costs.\nJustGiving was unable to provide a figure for how much money had been generated by transaction fees and contributions.\nTom Moore was born in Keighley, West Yorkshire, on 30 April 1920. He attended Keighley Grammar School before training as a civil engineer and enlisting in the Army during World War Two.\nHe rose to captain and served in India and Myanmar, then known as Burma.\nHe will celebrate his 100th birthday on 30 April and while his initial plans were scuppered by coronavirus, he said the national outpouring of love and support for him was \"a party enough for me\".\nFor the past 12 years Capt Tom has lived with his family - daughter Hannah Ingram-Moore and grandchildren Benji and Georgia - at a house in Marston Moretaine, a small Bedfordshire village.\nHis name has been added to a list of the village's most notable people on Wikipedia, where he stands alongside a former speaker of the House of Commons, two cricketers and a man who lost an arm at the Battle of Waterloo.\nAnd his fame is spreading, with people from all over the country seeking to wish him well ahead of his birthday at the end April.\nVillage postmaster Bill Chandi said hundreds of birthday cards had been arriving.\nCapt Tom's daughter Hannah called her father a \"beacon of hope in dark times\".\n\"I think we all need something like this to believe in and it's for such an amazing cause,\" she said. \nFormer F1 champion Damon Hill congratulated him on the \"brilliant idea and for pulling it off\", while current champion Lewis Hamilton called him a \"total inspiration\".\nCapt Tom's story brings some solace during a global pandemic.

Not being able to get food is an extra worry they do not need.\"\nThe system is running along different lines from that in England, where a single list of shielded people has been compiled, and the Scottish system has been slower to get started\nTesco and Sainsbury's have begun offering delivery slots to some vulnerable customers, but of the five retailers involved in the scheme so far, most say few slots have been reserved.\nTesco said those in the \"shielded\" category should be able to see slots online that were reserved only for them. Others have not made distinct slots available.\nSainsbury's said it had already sent out 10,000 offers to those who registered, but there was little evidence that delivery slots were available on anything like that scale.\nSome retailers, including Asda and Waitrose, are emphasising the use of store cards allocated to voluntary helpers, who do shopping for those unable to get out of their homes.\nBlood Cancer UK said the patients it represented were unable to get deliveries and were struggling to get food.\nIts chief executive has written to the Deputy First Minister John Swinney calling on the Scottish government to take urgent action, as well as the chief executives of six major retailers.\nThe charity said \"many people with blood cancer in Scotland still have not received a letter from their doctors saying that they are at a higher risk of serious illness or death than the general population if they get coronavirus\".\nHowever, Nicola Sturgeon told a virtual First Minister's Questions on Thursday that everyone regarded as \"shielded\" had now been notified, totalling 157,000 Scots.\nIn response to a question from Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw, Ms Sturgeon emphasised that the list was drawn up by medical experts.\nMr Carlaw has criticised the handling of the grocery delivery system and said: \"The SNP dithered and eventually came up with a convoluted system, which hasn't worked properly, and resulted in a pitiful number of shielded people receiving the help they need\".\nBlood Cancer UK said about 10,000 people in Scotland have blood cancers such as leukaemia and lymphoma.\nGoing through treatment, they have very low immunity and natural protection against disease.\nOthers in the \"shielded\" category include people going through treatment for other forms of cancer, taking drugs that suppress immunity, organ transplant recipients, those with some lung or chest conditions or diseases, and some pregnant women with heart disease.\nThose regarded as shielded should have received a letter, explaining precautions they should take for their health, along with pointers to advice and offers of help.\nBy sending a short text message to a given number, they can register to be kept in touch for the initial 12-week period they are to stay at home or have limited contact with those they live with.\nAnother code registers them for free weekly boxes of groceries. A further code, sent by text message, puts them on the list of people wanting priority access for supermarket home deliveries of groceries.\nTranches of data from that supermarket delivery list are in the process of being handed over to the five retailers now working with the Scottish government on the scheme.\nThose companies, which already have one of these people registered as customer, are getting in touch by email to explain how they can access the service. However, that is no guarantee of a delivery slot. Not all retailers are reserving spaces for this group, or are able to through the software they use.\nThe Scottish government is being notified of those vulnerable people who have no previous record of ordering groceries for home delivery. However, it seems that list is still being prepared for one or several retailers to make approaches. The process has been delayed by concerns about data and privacy protection.\nThe Scottish government has set up a text message service to communicate with those in the shielded category.\nMore than 60,000 have so far been in touch to say they want to use it. Of them, 30,000 have taken up the offer of a free, weekly delivery of a box of food and household necessities, supplied by wholesaler Brakes.\nSo far, 48,000 boxes have been delivered.\nA spokesman said: \"We will continue to add to the central list to ensure people are supported to shield. If people have not received a letter but feel they should be in the shielding group, they should speak to their GP or specialist clinician.\n\"Our free-of-charge grocery packages have been delivered directly to doorsteps since 3 April.  While not everyone who is shielding needs assistance with groceries, so far 60,000 people have registered for the shielding text message service, and over 30,000 people have signed up for these regular box deliveries.\n\"We are also working with the main supermarkets so that they can prioritise delivery slots for those who are shielding.\" "}

Otherwise, hospitals would break down,\" he added.\nThis is a stark warning.\nTwo medical associations said the coronavirus outbreak was reducing the ability of Japan's hospitals to treat other, serious, medical emergencies.\nHospitals are already turning away patients, and all this while the number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 remains relatively low compared with other countries.\nDoctors have complained of a lack of protective equipment, which suggests Japan has not prepared well for the virus. This is despite the fact it was the second country outside China to record an infection, way back in January.\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been criticised for not introducing restrictions to deal with the outbreak sooner for fear they could harm the economy.\nHis government has argued with the governor of Tokyo, who wanted tougher measures introduced more quickly.\nOnly on Thursday did Mr Abe extend a state of emergency to the whole country.\nThe government is also working to increase the rate of testing by introducing drive-through facilities. In recent weeks, Japan has conducted far fewer tests than in other countries and experts say this has made it more difficult to track the spread of the disease.\nLast month it conducted just 16% of the number of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests that South Korea did, according to data from Oxford University.\nAnd unlike South Korea - which has brought its outbreak largely under control through a programme of large-scale testing - the Japanese government said that carrying out widespread testing was a \"waste of resources\".\nTesting is also governed by local health centres, not on the national government level - and some of these local centres are not equipped to carry out testing on a major scale.\nBut, on Friday, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe indicated that the government was shifting its policy on testing and rolling it out more widely.\n \"With help from regional medical associations, we will set up testing centres,\" he told a news conference.\n\"If home doctors have decided testing is necessary, test samples are taken at these centres and sent to private inspection firms\" he said.  \"Thus, the burden on public health centres will be lessened.\"\nHis comments came shortly after he announced a nationwide state of emergency due to the worsening outbreak.\nThe move allowed regional governments to urge people to stay inside, but without punitive measures or legal force. It will remain in force until 6 May.\nAfter the initial state of emergency came into force on 8 April, a number of other regional governors called for the measures to be extended to their areas, saying that cases were growing and their medical facilities were overwhelmed.\nJapan's two emergency medical associations also issued a joint statement warning that they were \"already sensing the collapse of the emergency medical system\".\nAnd the mayor of Osaka appealed for people to donate their raincoats, so they could be used as personal protective equipment (PPE) for health workers whom he said were being forced to fashion PPE out of rubbish bags."}

But for the moment he has the security of being indoors.\nHe usually sells the Big Issue and says he misses his customers and the social life outside, as the magazine has had to stop sales on the streets.\nLord Bird, founder of the Big Issue, says putting homeless people into empty hotels has become a chance to get to grips with rough sleeping.\n\"We believe very strongly it's an opportunity to move people indoors - and that it's something that should become permanent.\"\nHe says there is an irony that attitudes towards rough sleepers have \"gone from utter neglect from the authorities to saying you matter because of fear of spreading the virus\".\nBut he warns \"not to expect a happy-ever-after\" outcome - as people living on the streets will have many complex problems from \"decades of neglect\" and might not find it easy to be kept alone indoors.\n\"The streets have been turned into a theatre of social collapse,\" says Lord Bird, whose magazine is now being sold in supermarkets and online.\nDave, who has been homeless for 15 years, has been put up in a flat in Dawlish in Devon.\nHe misses the outdoors and the sounds of sleeping by the sea, but says he has adapted to the indoor life.\nWith a roof over his head, he is thinking of volunteering for the NHS.\n\"The extra security is nice,\" Dave says, and he thinks it will help homeless people who were at risk from \"undesirables\" who might prey on them.\n\"A lot of vulnerable people on the streets will be away from that now. It's great. \n\"It raises a few questions about why they couldn't do it before,\" he says.\nNickie Aiken, MP for the Cities of London and Westminster, said there had to be \"plans in place to avoid a cliff edge situation once the lockdown is lifted\". \nShe said funding specialist workers to go into the hotels to help rough sleepers \"kick their drink and drugs habits\" would \"pay for itself\" in the long run.\n\"We have a golden opportunity to help more people to turn their lives around and seek the support they so desperately need. It would be unforgivable to waste this chance,\" said Ms Aiken.\nA spokeswoman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said there had been a \"massive collaborative effort across government, local authorities, health providers and charities - backed by \u00a31.6bn of government funding to help councils respond to coronavirus\".\nShe said the scheme for rough sleepers would ensure \"some of the most vulnerable in society are protected from the pandemic. We're also helping vital services, such as mental health or drug and alcohol addiction support, to remain open\"."}

Mr Trump may be seeking to encourage his political base to protest against Democrats, the BBC's Anthony Zurcher says.\nDemonstrations calling on authorities to end the shutdown have occurred in Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina, Minnesota, Utah, Virginia and Kentucky. \nBut Mr Trump did not mention Ohio and Utah, which both have Republican governors.\nHis comments came shortly after the US saw its highest daily death toll from coronavirus, recording 4,591 deaths in 24 hours on Thursday.\nThat rise could be because Johns Hopkins University, which records the data, began to include deaths with a Covid-19 probable cause.\nThe US has the highest number of cases and deaths worldwide, with nearly 700,000 confirmed infections and more than 36,000 deaths.\nMore demonstrations against the lockdown measures are planned, including in Wisconsin, Oregon, Maryland, Idaho and Texas.\nThe protests have varied in size, ranging from a few dozen people in Virginia to thousands in Michigan.\nMinnesota Governor Tim Walz responded to the president's tweets, saying he called the White House to ask \"what they think we could have done differently\" but did not hear back.\n\"The president unveiled a three step plan that mirrors exactly what we're trying to do,\" Mr Walz told reporters. \nThe president's apparent support for the protests comes a day after his administration unveiled new guidance for re-opening state economies.\nThat guidance recommends three phases of slowly re-opening businesses and social life, with each phase lasting a minimum of 14 days. \nIt includes some recommendations across all three phases including good personal hygiene and employers developing policies to ensure social distancing, testing and contact tracing.\nDr Anthony Fauci, from the White House coronavirus taskforce, cautioned that even as restrictions were eased \"it's not game over\".\nHe warned that the virus might rebound, and there could be setbacks along the way.\nOn Friday morning Donald Trump fired off a series of tweets calling for the \"liberation\" of three states with Democratic governors, as though they were enemy-controlled territory.\nThe message seems apparent. \nThe governor of one, Michigan's Gretchen Whitmer, recently was the target of a mass protest at the state capital against her sweeping lockdown orders. A mixed crowd of conservatives, white nationalists and anti-government militias waved Confederate and pro-Trump flags, and signs accusing Whitmer of dictatorial overreach.\nAnother of the states, Virginia, had its own capital protests earlier in the year from gun-rights activists.\nThe president's social media fusillade suggests his goal is to reward - or encourage - such shows of force from his political base, as opinion polls indicate Trump's approval rating is sagging after a boost during the early weeks of the outbreak.\nTrump followed those incendiary tweets by criticising New York's Andrew Cuomo, another Democrat, for mishandling the pandemic and spending too much time \"complaining\".\nJust a day after Trump reportedly told governors in a conference call they would \"call the shots\" on when to begin easing restrictions, it appears the president wants to up the pressure - and the political risk - for Democrats by other means at his disposal.\nTrump has benefitted in the past from a finely tuned sense of the sentiments - and resentments - of his supporters. Friday morning could be an indication that he's positioning himself to again stand in their midst.\nProtesters say stringent restrictions on movement and businesses are an overreaction to the outbreak.\nOrganisers of the Liberate Minnesota protest wrote on Facebook: \"It is not the governor's place to restrict free movement of Minnesota citizens!\" \n\"President Trump has been very clear that we must get America back to work very quickly or the 'cure' to this terrible disease may be the worse option!\"\nThe group added that the state's economy would be \"dealt a death blow\" if restrictions continued.\nThe event now has over 600 attendees marked on Facebook and some 2,800 more users interested in the event.\nEarlier this week, in Michigan, thousands of protesting workers blocked roads, demanding the state reopen after Governor Whitmer extended stay-at-home restrictions.\nThe governor is also facing federal lawsuits against her orders shuttering non-essential businesses and limiting travel.\nHowever, public health experts, and some state governors including Republican governors, have stressed the importance of social distancing.\nOn Friday, Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced he was establishing a \"strike force\" to \"safely and strategically\" re-open America's second largest state. \nThe group of medical, public and private sector leaders will look into what services and activities may resume under existing guidelines. \nThe governor will offer a re-opening plan based on the findings on 27 April.\nIn addition, Mr Abbott said retail outlets that are able to deliver goods to customer's cars, homes or other locations with minimal contact may begin operating on 24 April. \nIn Florida, the mayor of Jacksonville said he would re-open beaches with limited hours starting on Friday.\nMayor Lenny Curry said residents must still practice social distancing but could use beaches for exercise and recreation. \nParks in the city will also be opened, though gatherings of more than 50 are banned.\nIn other developments: "}

They may not be reliable for your intended use; they may give a false reading and put you, your family or others at risk.\"\nHe added: \"As soon as we have found a test that works for this purpose, we will be in a position to roll them out across the country as a back-to-work test.\"\nSpeaking in Geneva, the World Health Organization's (WHO) Dr Maria van Kerkhove cast doubt on the benefit of rapid serology tests due to a lack of evidence around coronavirus immunity.\nShe said: \"There are a lot of countries that are suggesting using rapid diagnostic serological tests to be able to capture what they think will be a measure of immunity.\n\"Right now, we have no evidence that the use of a serological test can show that an individual has immunity or is protected from reinfection.\"\nShe added: \"These antibody tests will be able to measure that level of seroprevalence - that level of antibodies but that does not mean that somebody with antibodies means that they are immune.\"\nDr van Kerkhove said it was \"a good thing\" that so many tests are being developed, but she added: \"We need to ensure that they are validated so that we know what they say they attempt to measure they are actually measuring.\"\nThe first problem with antibody tests is there aren't any that work at scale, but even if they did there are potential issues. \nThere are no guarantees that if you have antibodies against the coronavirus that you are completely immune. \nAnd even if your antibodies do protect you from becoming sick, then you may be able to harbour the virus in your body and pass it to others. \nThere will be many challenges before immunity passports - when if you pass the antibody test you can go back to life as normal - will be practical. \nThis is the problem with a virus that has only been around for a couple of months - there is still too much we do not understand. \nHowever, the main appeal of antibody testing is to find out how many people have really been infected with the virus. \nHer colleague Dr Michael Ryan said antibody testing also raised ethical questions.\n\"You might have someone who believes they are seropositive [have been infected] and protected in a situation where they may be exposed and in fact they are susceptible to the disease,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, unions representing doctors and nurses have \nIt comes following warnings that some hospitals could run out of the gowns used in intensive care units this weekend.\nThe UK announced 847 new coronavirus-related deaths in hospitals in its latest figures on Friday, taking the total to 14,576.\nOn Friday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said swab tests - which assess whether someone currently has the coronavirus - will soon be rolled out to other key workers, including police officers, prison staff and firefighters. \nHe added some 50,000 NHS workers had been tested for the virus so far.\nHowever, he said it was \"frustrating\" there was currently more capacity tests each day than the numbers that were being taken up.

If you were the type to come home from the office, open the fridge and get a drink - well, you're probably not going to the office now, so it's tempting to have one earlier. \n\"You might think 'I wouldn't normally have a drink now\u2026 but heck, I'm in the middle of a global pandemic'.\"\nBut Clare, who stopped drinking five years ago, suggests the pandemic is also a great reason to give up booze. \nIt's important to remain \"level-headed\" at a time like this - especially those looking after children or aged parents, she says.\n\"Alcohol does compromise your immune system as well and it's a good idea to remain in peak mental and physical condition right now,\" she added.\nShe said she was also concerned some people may pick up a drinking pattern during the pandemic that is then difficult to stop. \nThe World Health Organization has also \nClaire Rostron, senior health sciences lecturer at the Open University, said: \"The way our brains work is that alcohol is something that's rewarding - and what our brains do is weigh up the effort and reward of pursuing it. \n\"Lockdown has made the pursuit of it more risky - you have to go out for it. For people who drink occasionally, the reward system is not so prominent, which means they might make the decision not to go.\"\nHowever, she said people are under stress right now and drinking releases dopamine, the body's feel-good chemical - so some are drinking either the same, or more. As it's also a sedative, people might be finding it helps them sleep.\n\"It's some people's coping mechanism,\" Claire said. \"I'm certainly still having a glass of wine or beer.

For those who need more support, Alcoholics Anonymous is offering help, including online meetings, she said. \nBut she adds some might find it easier to stop drinking now - as usually when you go out you \"have to justify why you're not having a drink\".\n\"But right now, everybody is in the same boat so you don't feel like a social leper,\" she says.\nThe research commissioned by charity Alcohol Change UK - which saw surveyed 2,000 people for the research - also suggested:\nAlcohol sales in supermarkets and corner shops \nIn all, it was an extra \u00a3199m compared to the same period in 2019. \nBut what about those who make their living in the alcohol industry? \nHolly-Anne Rolfe runs the Garden City Brewery bar and microbrewery in Letchworth, Hertfordshire, with husband Nick - and says they've been kept as busy as ever, by adapting to provide a takeaway and delivery service. \nBut she said it appeared they had a new set of regulars - with business as busy as usual, albeit in a different way. \n\"It's definitely a community support thing,\" she said, with locals wanting to help businesses. \"But people are also trying to have a nice experience in their own homes.\"\nThey are only opening a few days a week for limited hours - but brewing the same amount as normal.\n\"A lot of the older regulars haven't ordered, but it's just not something they would do,\" she said. \"Because they usually come to us for the social experience.\"\nThose coming down to collect a takeaway from the bar - socially distanced, with a one-in-one-out system - are seeing it as a \"bit of normality\", she added. \n\"It's nice for them to come down and see people they know and to get out of the house,\" said Holly-Anne. \n\"It's about keeping routines going.\""}

Everyone dropped everything,\" he said.\nAlready, their research has yielded surprising results, including:\nSchipher Medicine combines AI with something it calls network medicine - a method that views a disease via the complex interactions among molecular components.\n\"A disease phenotype is rarely due to malfunction of one gene or protein on its own - nature is not that simple - but the result of a cascading effect in a network of interactions between several proteins,\" Mr Saleh said.\nUsing network medicine, AI and a fusion of the two has led the consortium to identify 81 potential drugs that could help.\n\"AI can do a little better, not only looking at higher order correlations but little bits of independent information that traditional network medicine might miss,\" said Prof Albert-Laszlo Barabasi.\nBut AI alone would not have worked, they needed all three approaches. \n\"Different tools look at different perspectives but together are very powerful\" he added.\nSome AI companies are already claiming to have isolated drugs that could help.\nBenevolentAI has identified Baricitinib, a drug already approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, as a potential treatment to prevent the virus infecting lung cells. \nAnd it has now entered a controlled trial with the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\nMeanwhile, scientists from South Korea and the US using deep learning to investigate the potential for commercially available antiviral drugs have suggested atazanavir, used to treat Aids, could be a good candidate.\nOther companies are using AI for other purposes, such as analysing scans to ease the burden on radiologists and help predict which patients are most likely to need a ventilator.\nChinese technology giant Alibaba, for example, announced an algorithm it says can diagnose cases within 20 seconds, with 96% accuracy.\nBut some experts warn AI systems are likely to have been trained on data about advanced infections, making them less effective at detecting early signs of the virus. \nThere needed to be a global effort from policymakers to persuade the big pharmaceutical companies to join forces with smaller drug-data stores, academics and research charities to pool data resources, Prof Darzi said.\n\"The time has never been more important for drug-discovery data to open up its secrets for AI to help in the battle against Covid-19,\" he said."}

But Sahar Zand - who attended the event last April - reports that many local people believe that without this show of devotion to the Hindu deity, Shiva, crops are bound to fail.\nIt is early morning one day in mid-April, almost exactly a year ago. On the bank of the river Ganges, a handful of young men are sitting in a circle under the shade of a big tree. They are wearing bright red and are carefully sharpening iron rods, called bursees, each about 2ft (60cm) long. The sharper the rod, the lower the risk of injury in the ritual that awaits them later in the day.\nThe oldest member of the group, Sandos, 26, is the only one in this group who has taken part in the self-harming rituals before. Over the years he has had his lips, ears, arms, chest, belly and back impaled, he tells me. Yes, it was painful, he says. \"But pain is temporary, it's the reward that will last. We all have to pay a price to get what we want.\"\nThe reward they are seeking is a good harvest. In the village of Krishnadevpur in West Bengal, the pre-harvest festival of Gajan, coinciding with the end of the Bengali calendar, is the biggest celebration of the year. Participating is the ultimate way for the farmers to demonstrate their devotion to Hindu deity Shiva, who they believe is responsible for granting them a favourable climate for their crops.\n\"Once we start the rituals,\" Sandos tells me, \"our Lord Shiva will possess us, and we gain his superhuman strength and courage.\"\nListening carefully is Rahul, who says he has been pushing his parents to let him take part since he was 10. He's now 15 and this year, after a series of poor harvests, his parents have reluctantly agreed.\n\"Shiva is not happy and that is why we are all suffering, he is punishing us,\" Rahul says, as the rest of the group nods in agreement. \"So to protect ourselves and our families from his rage, it is now more important than ever to prove our devotion to him.\"\nOnce the iron rods are sharpened, one by one, the men dive into the holy river to purify their bodies and souls.\nFor the last six years, 22-year-old Ajoy has also taken part in Gajan, but not this time. He has grown sceptical. \"When I'm not seeing any results, why would I continue to harm myself?\" he asks. \nHe takes me to his family farm. Rows of rotten vegetables stretch before me, bordered by bare mango trees and fly-infested fruits. \n\"Sometimes we get no rain at all when we're supposed to and our crops die in a drought, other times we get such untimely and heavy rain that our fields flood and our harvest gets ruined,\" he says. Heatwaves have also been becoming more intense.\nThe problem is climate change, Ajoy tells me, not Shiva's rage, and once he finishes studying Bengali literature at a college in Kolkata, he has decided to look for a job elsewhere.\nLater in the day, as the festival is about to begin, hundreds of people fill an enclosure the size of a football field: there are women in colourful saris, excited children running around, bonfires, the smell of local snacks and spices, and loud music booming from loudspeakers.\nSandos and Rahul are gathered in the centre of the field with another 100 or so men who, like them, are wearing nothing but a red cloth around their waist. \"Shiva is the most powerful deity,\" they chant, \"and all his devotees must participate in his worship.\"\nThey have been chanting this mantra for hours - it is a crucial part of a process that is meant to bring them into a state of trance. They must fast on the day of the festival but may drink alcohol and smoke marijuana. This is all thought to reduce the risk of injury.\nAs Rahul dances around the priest who will shortly be impaling the devotees, his eyes are wide open but he looks right through me.\nThe crowd starts tightening as the impaling begins, the women ululating.\nI turn away involuntarily. When I look back I see that a couple of devotees, still chanting Shiva's mantra, already have several iron rods in their flesh - in their cheeks, ears, lips, nose, chest, arm, back.\nThe priest takes one of Sandos's sharpened rods and rubs it against a banana for lubrication. Muttering a mantra, he begins to pull on Sandos' cheek. Quickly he pierces it with the rod. It goes in one side and out the other. Sandos frowns and his whole body trembles. The priest penetrates the same cheek with two more rods, leaving them all in.\nRahul is next. He steps forward, his eyes tightly shut. The priest starts with his earlobe. Next his lower lip, which receives several piercings, as does his upper lip. Finally, the priest makes two wounds, each an inch deep, in Rahul's chest, leaving the rods in. A small teardrop is the only sign of pain I see on his face. \nHe tries to continue chanting Shiva's mantra but his words come out muffled - the iron rods sticking out of his face clearly restrict his facial movements. Another devotee picks Rahul up on his shoulders and starts parading around in a circle with the others, watched by the community.\nTo my amazement, I do not see a single drop of blood in the entire process.\nBut the festival is not quite over yet. The devotees are now preparing for Charak Puja, the last and arguably most gruesome part of the festival. For this closing ritual, self-torture is taken to the next level. A few experienced devotees will swing on a carousel, hanging from nothing more than two hooks pushed through the skin on their backs.\nFirst in line is Suman. He's 34 and says he's been taking part in Gajan rituals every year since he was 12.\nAt first the priest refuses to impale him, arguing he has no more space left on his back. But when Suman angrily insists, the priest slaps his lower back, grabs a handful of his flesh, stretches it as far he can, then forces the hook through. Suman's fists clench tightly, his eyes clamp shut, and the veins on his forehead look like they're about to pop. He faints. \nThey pour water on him and slap him to wake him up. Then he gets up, holding on to another devotee for balance, who directs him on to a platform to get on the carousel. They tie the rope to the hook.\nSuman is counterbalanced by another devotee on the other side of the carousel, both rotating as the rest of the attendees cheer them on. They display no sign of pain. Suman is smiling and interacting with the crowd underneath him.\nAfter a few rounds, the carousel slows down and Suman grabs one of the many babies that parents are holding up to receive Shiva's blessing. Suman and his counterpart hold a crying baby for one rotation, then return it to its parents and grab another.\n\"As long as the devotees are up there, they are not themselves, but they're Shiva in disguise,\" one mother tells me. \"When my lord has my baby, I have nothing to worry about.\"\nAfter about 10 minutes, the carousel stops and Suman gets off, replaced by another devotee. \"The whole time I was up there, I felt spiritually connected to god, I felt like a bridge between him and the rest of the community,\" he tells me with hooks still in his back. \nI ask him what he thinks would happen if Gajan was to stop taking place.\n\"It'll be the end of the world,\" Suman responds without hesitation. \"Lord Shiva's rage will destroy us all.\"\nBut this April, as the community was preparing for Gajan, the Indian government imposed a lockdown due to Covid-19.\nThis year Gajan did not take place - perhaps for the first time in thousands of years."}

Jack Goodman brings together what's been debunked this week by BBC Monitoring, Trending and Reality Check.\nWhatsApp messages claiming the BCG vaccine prevents coronavirus infection are inaccurate. \nThe Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin jab has been given to children around the world to fight off tuberculosis, and was widespread in secondary schools in the UK until 2005.\nIt's still given in the UK when a child or adult might be at risk of coming into contact with tuberculosis.\nIt's still common in many countries, such as Syria, where rumours are spreading that people shouldn't worry about coronavirus if they've had the BCG jab because it gives them immunity.\nA WhatsApp message in Arabic says that if you have the circular scar from the jab on your arm, you could be \"75% protected\" against Covid-19.\nHowever, the World Health Organization \nThe health body says two clinical trials are under way involving BCG, and when completed, their findings will be evaluated by the WHO.\nDespite the lack of medical evidence, global search for the term \"BCG\" has spiked, according to Google. \nThe WHO is concerned that increased demand for the vaccine means there'll be less of it available to inoculate children against tuberculosis. \nSimilar fears have also been voiced by suppliers in Japan, reporting a surge in demand for the BCG vaccine. \nThe head of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) unveiled a hand-held device this week which he claimed could identify people infected with coronavirus - and even contaminated surfaces - up to a distance of 100m and within five seconds. \nThe Physics Society of Iran described the announcement as \"pseudoscience\", \"unbelievable\" and on a par with \"sci-fi tales\". \nThe device bears an uncanny resemblance to fake bomb detector tools sold by British fraudsters more than a decade ago, all of which claimed to use the same \"electrostatic magnetic ion attraction\". \nTheir \"smart Covid-19 detector\" bears an uncanny resemblance to three fake bomb detector tools, sold by four British fraudsters more than a decade ago, which ended up in conflict zones and were used by a number of governments around the world \nEnd of Twitter post  by @Shayan86\nThe bogus bomb detectors were in fact empty cases with an aerial which swings according to the user's unconscious hand movements. They ended up in conflict zones and \nThis latest device has an almost identical case and antenna. \nEven the packaging, which can be seen in a clip of it being unveiled on Iranian state TV, looks similar. \nA video published by the Epoch Times, that contains claims that the coronavirus was created in a laboratory, has been marked false on Facebook where it has been watched almost 70 million times.\nThe opening feels like a slick and dramatic Netflix documentary - there's a flash and crack of a lightning bolt followed by ominous music. \nThe hour-long video includes a theory about a lab in Wuhan creating the virus and leaking it, due to poor security. \nThe BBC's science editor, Paul Rincon, says \nScientific analysis of the evidence shows the virus came from animals, and was not man-made.\nA peer-reviewed study in March found no evidence the coronavirus had been engineered, stating that \"it is improbable \nThe video also refers to a study from Indian researchers that claimed to find four new sequences had been inserted into the new coronavirus, which were also present in HIV, to suggest the virus is man-made.\nBut that paper, never peer-reviewed, was withdrawn by its authors. And \n\"Those sequences are so short that they match with many different organisms, not just HIV. It doesn't mean they're related,\" says Dr Jeremy Rossman, a virologist at the University of Kent.\nEpoch Times, based in New York City, was started by Chinese-Americans affiliated \nThe site spent heavily on pro-Donald Trump Facebook adverts last year, reported NBC News.\nBut in August Facebook banned it from taking out more ads for violating its policies.\nThis week \nIt followed familiar themes, such as criticising Mr Gates' support for vaccines.\nMultiple posts resurfaced on Facebook claiming that a research institute funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation owns the patent on the coronavirus causing the current pandemic. \nThese claims are all totally unsubstantiated. The suggestion that Covid-19 is a human creation sponsored by Bill Gates is false. \nThe coronavirus pandemic is \"fake\" and \"truly a farce\" is the claim of a holistic doctor interviewed by Canal Monteria, a Colombian news channel. The video went up last month but has now been viewed 18 million times and is still being shared on Facebook, which is why we're addressing it now. \nThe claim is clearly false - coronavirus does exist. \nThe man in the video goes unchallenged and says that present theories on viruses are all wrong, and recommends a video on YouTube that denies the existence of HIV to prove his point. \nHe doesn't at any point explain why people are getting ill.

Some people will need physiotherapy to walk again.\nBecause of what the body goes through in ICU, \n\"There does seem to be an added element with this disease - viral fatigue is definitely a huge factor,\" says Paul Twose, critical care physiotherapist at Cardiff and Vale University Health Board.\nThere have been reports from China and Italy of whole-body weakness, shortness of breath after any level of exertion, persistent coughing and irregular breathing. Plus needing a lot of sleep. \n\"We do know patients take a considerable period, potentially months, to recover.\"\nBut it is hard to generalise. Some people spend relatively short periods in critical care, while others are ventilated for weeks.\nWe don't know for sure as there is no long-term data, but we can look at other conditions.\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (called Ards) develops in patients whose immune systems go into overdrive, causing damage to the lungs.\n\"There is really good data that, even five years down the line, people can have ongoing physical and psychological difficulties,\" says Mr Twose.\nDr James Gill, a GP and lecturer at Warwick Medical School, says people also need mental health support to improve recovery.\n\"You're finding breathing difficult, then the doctor says 'We need to put you on a ventilator. We need to put you to sleep. Do you want to say goodbye to your family?'.\n\"PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder] in these most severe patients is not unsurprising. There will be significant psychological scars for many.\"\nThere remains the possibility that even some mild cases may leave patients with long-term health problems - such as fatigue. \nGetting an accurate figure is difficult.\nAs of 15 April, \nBut countries use different recording methods. Some are not publishing recovery figures and many mild infections will be missed.\nThere has been much speculation, but little evidence, on how durable any immunity is. If patients have successfully fought off the virus, they must have built up an immune response. \nReports of patients being infected twice may just be down to tests incorrectly recording they were free of the virus. \nThe immunity question is vital for understanding whether people can be reinfected and how effective any vaccine may be."}

But it then used its majority in parliament to extend that indefinitely, so the government now has the power to rule by decree for as long as necessary and can decide itself when the danger is over.\nCritics speak of an end to Hungary's democracy, but the justice minister insists the \"Authorisation Act\" will expire at the end of the emergency and it was both necessary and proportionate.\nIs it the end of democracy? Constitutional law expert Prof Zoltan Szente warns the pandemic could easily be used to maintain the government's extraordinary powers. \nAs it is the exclusive power of the government to decide when to end the state of danger, he says parliament has actually \"committed suicide\" by waiving its right of control over the government.\nIn theory there are still three checks on Viktor Orban's power:\nBut Mr Orban's Fidesz party has a decisive majority in parliament and all by-elections and referendums are postponed until the end of the emergency. \nThe Constitutional Court is already packed with Orban favourites but the one remaining thorn in the prime minister's side is the largely independent judiciary.\nThe ruling party needs to maintain its two-thirds majority in parliament to appoint a new Supreme Court president at the end of 2020. Then Mr Orban's power would be almost unassailable.\nTurkey's combative leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, does not need to use the coronavirus outbreak to usurp power because he has so much already. That is the view of human rights campaigners here.\n\"There is such a centralised system there's no need to have a further power grab,\" says Emma Sinclair-Webb, Turkey Director for Human Rights Watch.  \nHowever, she says there was an opportunistic attempt to \"test the water\" with proposals to increase control on social media companies. They were \"buried deep\" in a bill dealing mainly with economic measures to cushion the impact of the virus. \nThe aim, she says, was \"to strong-arm social media platforms to submit to government control and censorship\". The draft amendments were suddenly dropped but Ms Sinclair-Webb expects them to make a comeback in the future.\nTurkey's government is determined to control the narrative during the crisis. Hundreds have been arrested for \"provocative posts\" about Covid-19 on social media.  \nFew doctors have dared to speak out. \"Hiding the facts and creating a monopoly of information unfortunately became the way this country is being ruled,\" says Ali Cerkezoglu of the Turkish Medical Association. \"Doctors, nurses and health workers have got used to it in the past 20 years.\"\nLawyer Hurrem Sonmez worries the outbreak is a moment of opportunity for President Erdogan. \"Society, and the opposition, are weaker because of the pandemic,\" says Ms Sonmez, who has represented defendants in free speech cases. \n\"Everyone has the same agenda - the virus. The priority is to survive. There is a serious concern that the situation can be misused by this government.\" \nBack in January, the Kremlin thought it had everything worked out. \nIt would rewrite the Russian Constitution, primarily to allow Vladimir Putin to stand for two more terms in office. Then it would hold a triumphant \"national vote\" on 22 April for Russians to back the changes. The president's critics called it a \"constitutional coup\", but it seemed a done deal. \nCovid-19, though, has put everything on hold. President Putin has had to postpone the ballot: after all, how can you call people to come out and vote in the middle of a pandemic? The Kremlin's problem now is that, if and when the ballot does take place, endorsing a new Constitution may well be the last thing on Russian minds. \nCoronavirus lockdown is set to decimate the economy here, with predictions of a two-year long recession and millions of job losses. \nRussians tend to blame local officials and bureaucrats, not central authority, for their everyday problems. But history shows that when people here experience acute personal economic pain, they turn their ire on their country's leader. Such pain now seems inevitable. \nThat may explain why the Kremlin leader recently delegated power to regional governors to fight the coronavirus: now they share the responsibility.\nPresident Putin's supporters, including state media, will argue that in a national crisis Russia requires strong, stable leadership more than ever - in other words: that the Putin era should be extended. As for Kremlin critics, they have already accused the authorities of using the pandemic to tighten control. \nA new law rushed through parliament imposes tough punishments on people convicted of spreading what is deemed to be false information about coronavirus: fines equivalent to $25,000 or up to five years in prison. There are concerns about surveillance systems being rolled out to enforce quarantine. \nLockdown also means that opposition protests cannot take place: mass gatherings are currently banned to prevent the spread of the virus.  \nPoland's governing party is being accused of recklessly endangering lives by pushing ahead with May presidential elections during the pandemic. President Andrzej Duda, a government ally, has seen his poll numbers rise during the pandemic and is clear favourite to win.\nThe ruling Law and Justice party argues it is constitutionally obliged to hold the election and a postal-only vote is the safest solution under lockdown.\nThat is its preferred option, but it is also backing a proposal to change the constitution to allow President Duda to serve another two years, as long as he cannot seek re-election.\nThe opposition says a postal vote risks voters, postal workers and election staff. The EU and Poland's own electoral commission have also raised concerns about holding the vote.\nThere is a legal way to wait, the opposition insists, by declaring a state of natural disaster that bans elections whilst extraordinary measures are in force and for 90 days afterwards. The government says declaring extraordinary measures would make it liable for crippling compensation claims.\nIf elections do go ahead in May, they would not be fair, human rights groups say, because candidates have suspended campaigning while the incumbent still enjoys widespread media coverage helping the government and visiting health care workers. \nIf the election were postponed, Poland may well be in the midst of a recession, and Mr Duda's chances of re-election could be substantially diminished. Were an opposition candidate elected, the new president's power of veto could significantly disrupt the government's ability to push through its programme for the next three and a half years.\n\"This is a text book example of how to gain the biggest benefit from the crisis and to remain in power,\" Malgorzata Szuleka, a lawyer for the Helsinski Foundation for Human Rights in Warsaw told the BBC.

Politicians have engaged in contentious fights over the electoral process in legislatures and the courts.\nIn November voters are scheduled to head to the polls to select the next president, much of Congress and thousands of state-government candidates. But what could Election Day look like - or if it will even be held on schedule - is very much the subject of debate.\nHere are answers to some key questions. \nA total of 15 states have delayed their presidential primaries at this point, with most pushing them back until at least June. That presents the pressing question of whether the presidential election in November itself could be delayed.\nUnder a law dating back to 1845, the US presidential election is slated for the Tuesday after the first Monday of November every four years - 3 November in 2020. It would take an act of Congress - approved by majorities in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives and the Republican-controlled Senate - to change that. \nThe prospect of a bipartisan legislative consensus signing off on any delay is unlikely in the extreme.\nWhat's more, even if the voting day were changed, the US Constitution mandates that a presidential administration only last four years. In other words, Donald Trump's first term will expire at noon on 20 January, 2021, one way or another. \nHe might get another four years if he's re-elected. He could be replaced by Democrat Joe Biden if he's defeated. But the clock is ticking down, and a postponed vote won't stop it.\nIf there hasn't been an election before the scheduled inauguration day, the presidential line of succession kicks in. Second up is Vice-President Mike Pence, and given that his term in office also ends on that day, he's in the same boat as the president.\nNext in line is the Speaker of the House - currently Democrat Nancy Pelosi - but her two-year term is up at the end of December. The senior-most official eligible for the presidency in such a doomsday scenario would be 86-year-old Republican Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the president pro tem of the Senate. That's assuming Republicans still control the Senate after a third of its 100 seats are vacated because of their own term expirations.\nAll in all, this is much more in the realm of political suspense novels than political reality.\nWhile an outright change of the presidential election date is unlikely, that doesn't mean the process isn't at risk of significant disruption. \nAccording to University of California Irvine Professor Richard L Hasen, an election-law expert, Trump or state governments could use their emergency powers to drastically curtail in-person voting locations. \nIn the recently concluded Wisconsin primary, for instance, concerns about exposure to the virus, along with a shortage of volunteer poll-workers and election supplies, led to the closure of 175 of the 180 polling places in Milwaukee, the state's largest city.\nIf such a move were done with political interests in mind - perhaps by targeting an opponent's electoral strongholds - it could have an impact on the results of an election.\nHasen also suggests another more extraordinary, albeit unlikely, scenario. Legislatures, citing concerns about the virus, could take back the power to determine which candidate wins their state in the general election. There is no constitutional obligation that a state support the presidential candidate who wins a plurality of its vote - or that the state hold a vote for president at all. \nIt's all about the Electoral College, that archaic US institution in which each state has \"electors\" who cast their ballots for president. In normal times, those electors (almost always) support whoever wins the popular vote in their respective states. \nIt doesn't necessarily have to work that way, however. In the 1800 election, for example, several state legislatures told their electors how to vote, popular will be damned. \nIf a state made such a \"hardball\" move today, Hasen admits, it would probably lead to mass demonstrations in the streets. That is, if mass demonstrations are permitted given quarantines and social-distancing edicts.\nThe recent experience in the Wisconsin primary could serve as an ominous warning for electoral disruption to come - and not just because of the long lines for in-person voting at limited polling places, staffed by volunteers and national guard soldiers in protective clothing.\nPrior to primary day, Democratic governor Tony Evers and Republicans who control the state legislature engaged in high-stakes legal battles, one of which was ultimately decided by the US Supreme Court, over whether the governor had the legal power to postpone the vote until June or extend the absentee balloting deadline. \nIn March Republican Ohio Governor Mike DeWine had a similar court battle before his successful move to delay his state's primary.\nA federal judge in Texas on Wednesday issued an order that made fear of contracting the coronavirus a valid reason to request an absentee ballot in November. The state's requirements for mail-in voting had been some of the most stringent in the nation.\nIn a recent \nSuch concerns have increased pressure on states to expand the availability of mail-in ballots for all voters in order to minimise the risk of viral exposure from in-person voting.\nWhile every state provides for some form of remote voting, the requirements to qualify vary greatly.\n\"We have a very decentralised system,\" Hasen says. \"The states have a lot of leeway in terms of how they do these things.\"\nFive states in the western US, including Washington, Oregon and Colorado, conduct their elections entirely via mail-in ballot. Others, like California, provide a postal ballot to anyone who requests it. \nOn the other end of the spectrum, 17 states require voters to provide a valid reason why they are unable to vote in-person in order to qualify for an absentee ballot. These states have faced calls to relax their requirements to make absentee ballots easier to obtain - although some leaders are resisting. \nMike Parson, the Republican governor of Missouri, said on Tuesday that expanding absentee ballot access was a \"political issue\" and suggested that fear of contracting the virus is not, by itself, a reason to qualify for an absentee ballot.\nRepublicans in other states, including North Carolina and Georgia, have expressed similar sentiments. \nCongress could step in and mandate that states provide some minimum level of absentee balloting or mail-voting system in national elections, but given the existing partisan gridlock at the US Capitol, chances of that are slim.\nNo. Given the intense polarisation of modern politics, it shouldn't be surprising that whether - and how - to alter the way elections are conducted during a pandemic have become an increasingly contentious debate.\nDonald Trump himself has weighed in against expanded mail-in voting, saying that it is more susceptible to fraud. He also has suggested that increased turnout from easing balloting restrictions could harm Republican candidates,\n\"They had levels of voting, that if you ever agreed to it, you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again,\" he said in a recent Fox News interview.\nBut the evidence that conservatives are hurt more by mail-in voting is mixed, as Republicans frequently cast absentee ballots in greater numbers than Democrats. \nThe coronavirus outbreak is affecting every aspect of American life. While Trump and other politicians are pushing for life to return to some semblance of normalcy, there's no guarantee all will be well by June, when many states have rescheduled their primary votes, the August party conventions, the October scheduled presidential debates or even November's election day. \nIn normal times, the months ahead would mark a drumbeat of national political interest and activity that grows to an election day crescendo. At this point, everything is in doubt - including, for some, the foundations of American democracy itself.\n\"Even before the virus hit, I was quite worried about people accepting the results of the 2020 election because we are very hyperpolarised and clogged with disinformation,\" says Hasen, who wrote a recent book titled Election Meltdown: Dirty Tricks, Distrust, and the Threat to American Democracy. \n\"The virus adds much more to this concern.\""}

But the number is still high enough to trouble MPs, who on Friday received a letter from the UK aviation minister explaining why flights were still in the air.\nIt is the airlines, who say nearly all of their passengers on their flights into Heathrow are people heading home, which decide which routes to run. \n\"No-one is on holiday,\" says Airlines UK chief executive Tim Alderslade, whose group represents British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and other UK-based carriers.\nThat was certainly the picture at a deserted Heathrow Terminal 5 when I visited this week. I watched from a distance as a trickle of mask-sporting passengers appeared after flying in on British Airways from Los Angeles. \nSome people on social media have questioned why flights are still coming in from countries such as the US, Italy and Spain, where Covid-19 is also prevalent. \nAlitalia said the four daily flights it is now operating between Rome and London are \"quite empty\" flying into Heathrow. \nHowever, on the return leg to Rome, its aircraft are \"almost full\" of Italian citizens who want to fly back to Italy. Those people travelling to Italy must fill in a declaration to say that their journey is essential. \nMadrid and Barcelona are, like Heathrow, hub airports. That means many passengers flying in from there will have started their journey elsewhere, such as airports in Latin America. \nAnd many people flying into Heathrow will transit and fly straight back out again to another destination. \nMany airlines would not disclose exactly how many passengers they have been ferrying into London. \nHowever, American Airlines said social distancing had been possible \"for all passengers\", suggesting that its aircraft have a lot of empty seats. \nPassenger numbers have been so low for Dutch carrier KLM that over the past few days, it has had to cancel its only daily flight from Amsterdam Schiphol into Heathrow.\nIn normal times, it runs 11 of those flights in a single day. \nVirgin Atlantic revealed that many of its commercial flights which have been running over the past couple of weeks have only, on average, been a quarter full. \nAnd my understanding is that British Airways is, globally, currently carrying a minuscule fraction of its usual passenger load.  \nBut if passenger flights are not full of passengers right now, their belly will be full of cargo which, because of demand, now travels at a premium.\nCargo has become a vital source of income for airlines, which have had their passenger revenue slashed in apocalyptic fashion. \nAt the same time, their high fixed costs, such as maintaining, leasing and parking aircraft, remain.\nIn specific cases, airlines such as BA and Virgin Atlantic have been using passenger airliners to carry solely cargo, namely medical supplies such as ventilator parts, face masks and protective clothing (PPE).\nOver a 10-day period earlier this month, Virgin Atlantic ran 20 cargo-only flights into Heathrow. \nIt ran just 15 commercial passenger flights over the same period. \nWhen a passenger aircraft is used to carry cargo, most of the seats can be covered with netting, so that supplies can travel in the cabin as well as in the belly of the plane. \nNormally, most of the world's air cargo is transported in the hold of passenger aircraft. \nBut with the vast majority of airliners grounded, cargo companies have had to step up their operations in an effort to meet the demand. \nCompanies such as FedEx Express, DHL and IAG Cargo (a sister company of BA and Iberia) have been ferrying medical supplies into the UK, namely from China. \nThere is \"a huge demand\" for component parts for projects to manufacture respirators in the UK, according to Trevor Hoyle from FedEx Express. \nHe said his company had also moved \"a huge amount\" of personal protective equipment (PPE) into the UK in recent days. \nThe number of cargo-only flights travelling into Heathrow has grown exponentially throughout the crisis. \nAnd despite most passenger flights being grounded, East Midlands Airport, which boasts the UK's \"largest dedicated air cargo operation\", has seen a rise in overall flight numbers because of the demand for freight.  \nAs for getting people home, BA and Virgin Atlantic are also running official repatriation flights for the Foreign Office.\nThe UK government says it has brought back 7,300 people on 35 flights since the coronavirus outbreak began in China. However, the vast bulk of people returning have travelled via commercial routes. \nIt's estimated that 1.3 million people have arrived back in the UK on commercially operated aircraft over that same period, but thousands of British residents are still stranded abroad.\nOne of those to return was Kiran Sandhu, who was flown home this week from India, where she was visiting family. When she left India, Kiran was given a temperature check and had to answer questions about whether she had Covid-19 symptoms.\nBut when she landed in the UK, there were no such questions or tests.\n\"It was a bit confusing,\" she says. \"You just assume that if one airport is doing it, then other airports would follow through with the same regulation and process.\"\nPublic Health England says checks are not effective, because some people carrying Covid-19 do not have a temperature and some show no symptoms at all.\nThis may not remain the case forever.

China has insisted there was no cover-up.\nIt has been accused of downplaying the severity of its virus outbreak.\nWuhan's 11 million residents spent months in strict lockdown conditions, which have only recently been eased.\nThe latest official figures bring the death toll in the city in China's central Hubei province to 3,869, increasing the national total to more than 4,600.\nChina has confirmed nearly 84,000 coronavirus infections, the seventh-highest globally, according to Johns Hopkins University data.\nIn a statement released on Friday, officials in Wuhan said the revised figures were the result of new data received from multiple sources, including records kept by funeral homes and prisons. \nDeaths linked to the virus outside hospitals, such as people who died at home, had not previously been recorded. \nThe \"statistical verification\" followed efforts by authorities to \"ensure that information on the city's Covid-19 epidemic is open, transparent and the data [is] accurate\", the statement said. \nIt added that health systems were initially overwhelmed and cases were \"mistakenly reported\" - in some instances counted more than once and in others missed entirely.\nA shortage of testing capacity in the early stages meant that many infected patients were not accounted for, it said.\nA spokesman for China's National Health Commission, Mi Feng, said the new death count came from a \"comprehensive review\" of epidemic data.\nIn its daily news conference, the foreign ministry said accusations of a cover-up, which have been made most stridently on the world stage by US President Donald Trump, were unsubstantiated. \"We'll never allow any concealment,\" a spokesman said. \nFriday's revised figures come amid growing international concern that deaths in China have been under-reported. Questions have also been raised about Beijing's handling of the epidemic, particularly in its early stages.\nIn December 2019, Chinese authorities launched an investigation into a mysterious viral pneumonia after cases began circulating in Wuhan. \nChina reported the cases to the World Health Organization (WHO), the UN's global health agency, on 31 December. \nBut WHO experts were only allowed to visit China and investigate the outbreak on 10 February, by which time the country had more than 40,000 cases.\nThe mayor of Wuhan has previously admitted there was a lack of action between the start of January - when about 100 cases had been confirmed - and 23 January, when city-wide restrictions were enacted.\nAround that time, a doctor who tried to warn his colleagues about an outbreak of a Sars-like virus was silenced by the authorities. Dr Li Wenliang \nWuhan's death toll increase of almost exactly 50% has left some analysts wondering if this is all a bit too neat.\nFor months questions have been asked about the veracity of China's official coronavirus statistics. \nThe inference has been that some Chinese officials may have deliberately under-reported deaths and infections to give the impression that cities and towns were successfully managing the emergency.\nIf that was the case, Chinese officials were not to know just how bad this crisis would get in other countries, making its own figures now seem implausibly small.\nThe authorities in Wuhan, where the first cluster of this disease was reported, said there had been no deliberate misrepresentation of data, rather that a stabilisation in the emergency had allowed them time to revisit the reported cases and to add any previously missed.\nThat the new death toll was released at the same time as a press conference announcing a total collapse in China's economic growth figures has led some to wonder whether this was a deliberate attempt to bury one or other of these stories.\nThen again, it could also be a complete coincidence.\nChina has been pushing back against US suggestions that the coronavirus came from a laboratory studying infectious diseases in Wuhan, the BBC's Barbara Plett Usher in Washington DC reports.\nUS President Donald Trump and some of his officials have been flirting with the outlier theory in the midst of a propaganda war with China over the origin and handling of the pandemic, our correspondent says. \nMr Trump this week halted funding for the World Health Organization (WHO), accusing it of making deadly mistakes and overly trusting China.\n\"Do you really believe those numbers in this vast country called China, and that they have a certain number of cases and a certain number of deaths; does anybody really believe that?\" Mr Trump said at the White House on Wednesday.\nFrench President \nOn Thursday, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: \"We'll have to ask the hard questions about how [coronavirus] came about and how it couldn't have been stopped earlier.\"\nBut China has also been praised for its handling of the crisis and the unprecedented restrictions that it instituted to slow the spread of the virus. \nWHO Director General "}

For me it was about being at Leeds United and playing with that group of players and staff. \n\"It was magic.\"\nAlthough a member of the squad, Hunter did not play during England's triumphant 1966 World Cup campaign, with their central defensive partnership formed by Jack Charlton - his Leeds team-mate - and captain Bobby Moore.\nThe England national team said they were \"extremely saddened\" by Hunter's death and that \"all of our thoughts are with his family, friends and supporters\".\nAfter leaving Leeds in 1976, Hunter also played for Bristol City and Barnsley, managing the Tykes and Rotherham after he retired from playing.\nThe Professional Footballers' Association said: \"Football has lost a legend and we join the entire football community in mourning this loss.\"\n\"He was somebody you never liked playing against because he did let players know he was around.

He is completely right. The CBILS scheme is not working.

This is not going to be a sudden drop, there will be a plateau - it will take a while for the numbers to come right down and that's why it's important that we continue with the strong social distancing measures that we have in place.\"\nSir Patrick added that he unfortunately expected the number of coronavirus-related deaths to continue to plateau \"for a little while\" before starting to come down slowly. \nIn other developments:"}

The overall figure does not include hundreds more who have died in residential and nursing homes.\nOn Thursday, as Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab announced the extension of lockdown restrictions for \"at least\" another three weeks, he said there remained \"issues with the virus spreading in some hospitals and in care homes\".\nAmong five conditions he said must be met before curbs on daily life could be lifted were making sure the NHS could cope and ensuring PPE supplies could meet demand.\nIn other developments:\nLast week, Mr Hancock said there was \"enough PPE to go around, but only if it's used in line with our guidance\", adding there was a \"huge task\" to make sure those who need it get it.\nA gown is a piece of PPE used to protect the body of those who might come into contact with coronavirus.\nIt should be made of water-resistant material and have long sleeves. If the gown is not water resistant, a waterproof apron is needed underneath to protect the wearer from droplets containing the virus.\nThe shortage of non-surgical gowns is a critical problem facing the NHS as it struggles to secure enough kit for frontline staff. \nA leaked Public Health England document this week advised health workers to reuse protective gowns and masks only as a \"last resort\".\nAs the world fights coronavirus, the demand for gowns is at levels never seen before. \nAlmost all of the UK's gowns used by the NHS are made in China and the Far East.\nThese decisions have been driven by cost, as all sectors seek the cheapest prices. \nBut as every country in the world fights for finite supplies, a UK solution has been sought. \nThe government and management consultancy Deloitte approached well known UK garment brands asking if they could help make PPE.\nThey also requested that UK manufacturers complete a survey to share what they could make.\nEarlier this week, Barbour began distributing gowns from its factory in the north-east of England.\nBurberry is still making the final adjustments to its factory and production is expected to start next week.\nGetting a supply chain formalised using UK factories has been difficult.\nUK garment factories approached by the BBC have said the government does not fully understand what is possible in the UK, and which firms could produce what. This lack of understanding has caused production delays.\nDelays around certification of gowns for use is also slowing down the manufacturing process.\nSome factories say it could be another two weeks before the necessary paperwork is signed off and they can manufacture the gowns.\nThis comes as factories around the UK are empty. Machinists and pattern cutters have been sent home and furloughed.\nTo add to the frustration of factory bosses, they say they're getting upsetting calls from NHS hospitals and workers begging for gowns.\nA Department for Health and Social Care spokesman said: \"Adequate supply of protective equipment is an international issue facing many countries during this global pandemic.\" \nNearly one billion pieces of protective equipment had been delivered to the frontline so far, the spokesman said.\n\"There is also a 24-hour NHS-run helpline where NHS and social care workers can call to report supply disruption. \n\"We continue to work around the clock to give the NHS and the wider social care sector the equipment they need and it is crucial the guidance for protective equipment is followed closely,\" the spokesman added.\nPlease include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

It will temporarily help pay the wages of people who can't do their jobs, to help companies retain them.\nBeing furloughed means employees are kept on the payroll, even though they aren't working.\nBusinesses can claim 80% of their employees' wages from the government, up to a maximum of \u00a32,500 per person, per month before tax. The company can top up this pay if it chooses. It must write to affected employees to let them know they have been furloughed.\nThe scheme came into effect on 1 March and was due to last an initial three months. It has since been extended until at least the end of June. However, reimbursements to companies will not start until at least the end of April.\nOne in four businesses had shut temporarily within the first two weeks of lockdown, \nPotentially yes, if your company can't give you work to do because of the coronavirus outbreak. \nInitially the scheme only supported those on an employer's PAYE payroll on 28 February 2020, but the cut off date was extended to 19 March.

But employees hired for the first time after that date are not eligible for it.\nMany people have complained the scheme does not extend to those who had already signed a contract or switched jobs after the cut-off date. \nAny UK organisation with employees can apply\nMost public sector organisations will be providing essential public services or helping with the response to the outbreak in a different way, the government says.\nApprentices can be furloughed in the same way as other employees, and still continue their training. And an individual can furlough an employee, such a nanny, but only if they are paid through PAYE. \nAnyone placed on furlough has the same employment rights as before. If you are ill you are eligible for statutory sick pay and can be placed on furlough when you recover.\nIf you are shielding because of health concerns or have childcare or other caring responsibilities, you are also eligible for furlough. Staff on maternity, paternity, adoption or shared parental leave will continue to receive statutory pay from the government. \nThe government will only cover up to 80% of a worker's core salary. So, that doesn't include any bonus or commission payments.  It will also cover the minimum automatic enrolment pension contributions made by your employer, and their National Insurance contributions.\nIf your wages differ from month to month, your company should base your salary either on what you earned in the same month the year before, or on your average monthly earnings from the 2019-20 tax year, whichever is higher. \nEmployers do not have to top up salaries that no longer reach the minimum wage.\nYou can't do any work for your employer if you have been furloughed. \nIf you have more than one employer, you can receive furlough from any of them, up to a maximum of \u00a32,500 a month per employer. \nYou can also continue working for any that still need you. You can do work for a new employer, provided you are not breaching any existing contracts or the coronavirus restrictions.\nYou can volunteer to help with the efforts to curb the virus - and are being encouraged to do so.  You can also volunteer for your company as long as you aren't creating revenue for them or providing a service. Employers are encouraged to use this time to give employees additional training, but must top up furlough payments if they do not reach minimum wage.\nOf course, many firms haven't furloughed staff but have asked them to work reduced hours for reduced pay, which they will have to fund as normal.\nCompanies are under no obligation to keep on any employees when they stop receiving furlough, although they cannot use these payments to subsidise redundancy packages.\nThe scheme currently runs until 1 June, and the government has indicated it will be extended beyond that if necessary. \nThe hope is that by the time furlough ends, restrictions will have been lifted and businesses will be able to stand on their own two feet and start paying full salaries again.

A dedicated helpline was also set up for families that needed a corpse removed from their home.\nJorge Wated, the head of a police unit created to tackle the problem, said earlier this week that 771 bodies had been removed from houses in the city.\nAccording to the government's figures, 14,561 people have died in Guayas province since the beginning of March from all causes. The province normally sees 2,000 deaths a month on average. \nEcuador as a whole has had 8,225 confirmed cases of coronavirus to date, according to Johns Hopkins University, though a lack of widespread testing means this is likely a significant undercount.\nAcross Latin America, Covid-19 has been dubbed a rich person's disease. A virus introduced to the region by affluent parts of society who had been travelling abroad.  \nThe case of Ecuador is no different but experts have suggested that the country's deep ties with Spain and transport links between there and Guayaquil, Ecuador's biggest city, could be partly responsible for higher numbers. Indeed, the first recorded case was of an Ecuadorean woman returning from Spain. \nBut the high death toll is also a devastating consequence of the combination of an overburdened healthcare system and a deeply unequal society which means not everybody is able - or willing - to socially distance and stop work. \nAuthorities argue they were quick to impose strict regulations and people chose to disregard measures but experts argue more could be done - and one thing that could help is testing. While Ecuador is not the worst offender in the region, low testing rates have made it very difficult to understand how the virus has moved through communities, some of which have been devastated by the high death toll.\nEcuador's vice president, Otto Sonnenholzer, apologised to the nation earlier this month for the government's slow response to the pandemic. \n\"We have seen images that should never have happened, and as your public servant I apologise,\" Mr Sonnenholzer said.\nGuayaquil is densely populated and has high levels of poverty, with many residents living in close proximity."}
{"title": "Coronavirus: Testing and why it matters", "time": "2020-04-17 13:23:25", "author": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51943612?intlink_from_url=https://www.bbc.com/news/coronavirus&link_location=live-reporting-story", "content": "The UK government wants to do 100,000 coronavirus tests a day by the end of April, but has faced criticism for not increasing the number more quickly. By mid-April, 21,000 tests were being conducted a day, on 14,000 people.\nSo what are the tests and why has it been difficult to scale them up?\nThe tests currently being used in UK hospitals are to see if somebody currently has Covid-19.\nThey are being carried out in hospitals and at 29 drive-through testing centres across the country.\nThese are done by taking a swab of the nose or throat, which is sent off to a lab to look for signs of the virus's genetic material.\nThe other type of test the government wants to use is an antibody test. These are done to see if someone has already had the virus.\nThey work by looking for signs of immunity, by using a drop of blood on a device, a bit like a pregnancy test. \nThe government bought three-and-a-half million antibody tests, but has not yet found one that is reliable enough to use.\nThe UK did not start with the resources to do mass testing, unlike some other countries. \nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said: \"We have the best scientific labs in the world but we did not have the scale.  My German counterpart for instance could call upon 100 testing labs ready and waiting when the crisis struck.\"\nThe UK government also took a different approach at the beginning of the crisis, using a smaller number of labs and keeping more control centrally. \nThere have been suggestions it did not act quickly enough, as countries like Germany and South Korea - which have been able to test far more widely than the UK has - rapidly stockpiled kits and made the test available to a larger number of labs. \nAt first, Public Health England was only using its own eight laboratories, later expanding to a further 40 NHS labs. It was only at the end of March that the government said it would work to recruit more laboratories from universities, research institutes and private companies. \nAs well as lab space and people to do the swabs, UK testing efforts have been held back by challenges in getting hold of swabs, testing kits and reagents.\nA reagent is the substance used to extract the virus's genetic material so it can be studied more easily. At the moment there is high global demand for reagents, which is why they are hard to obtain. \nThe government is trying to ease this shortage by involving pharmaceutical companies GlaxoSmithKline and Astrazeneca in producing reagents in the UK.\nThere are two main reasons for testing people - to diagnose them individually, and to work out how far the virus has spread. \nHaving this second piece of information could help the health service plan for extra demand, including on intensive care units. \nTesting could also inform decisions around social distancing measures. For example, if large numbers of people were found to have already been infected, then a lockdown might become less necessary. \nAnd not testing more widely means many people might be self-isolating for no reason, including NHS workers.\nTesting is not yet available for most people.\nAt the moment, tests are reserved for seriously ill patients in hospital and for certain key workers.\nTests had previously been available for health and social care workers who have coronavirus symptoms, or who live in a household with someone who does.\nThe eligibility has now been expanded beyond health and care workers to include the police, the fire service, prison officers, judges and some local government staff. Workers responsible for administering benefits can also get tests.  \nThis means that if even if you develop symptoms, but you don't work in one of those roles, then you can't currently find out if you have coronavirus.\nIf you do work in one of those roles and you develop symptoms, then the government's advice is that you should \"let your employer know you're isolating\" and they should \"confirm if you're eligible and help you get a test appointment\".\nThe Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said that there is currently extra \"capacity\" in the system, particularly at the drive-through testing centres, but that there hasn't been \"enough demand\".\nBut this has been challenged by some of the bodies representing key workers, who have said that a major issue is the accessibility of those centres.\nDame Donna Kinnair, from the Royal College of Nursing, said: \"What I'm hearing from the frontline is nurses are sometimes driving two hours, feeling very unwell with possible symptoms of coronavirus and driving to a testing station.\"\nMatt Wrack, from the Fire Brigades Union, responded directly to the suggestion from Mr Hancock that the problem has been a lack of \"demand\" for tests, saying: \"This is surely an issue of accessibility, rather than frontline staff not wanting to be tested. Many of the testing centres are far out of town and require extended trips in a car.\"\nThe diagnostic tests used in hospitals are very reliable. \nHowever, that doesn't mean they will pick up every case of coronavirus. A patient at the very start of their infection or with relatively low levels of the virus may show up as a negative. \nAnd a swab may come back negative if it has not picked up enough of the virus from the back of the throat. \nSo far, antibody tests have not proved to be as reliable.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock has said that 15 of the most promising antibody tests had been tested, but none was good enough. \nProf John Newton, who is overseeing testing, said tests bought from China had been able to identify antibodies in patients who had been seriously ill with coronavirus, but didn't pick up the milder cases."}

They then combined it with parts of the new coronavirus.\nThe result is, hopefully, a safe virus that trains the immune system to fight Covid-19. \nThe big question is whether this experimental vaccine will actually work. \nProf Sarah Gilbert, the lead researcher developing the vaccine, says she is 80% sure it will.\n\"This is my view, because I've worked with this technology a lot, and I've worked on the Mers-vaccine trials [another type of coronavirus], and I've seen what that can do.\n\"And, I think, it has a very strong chance of working.\"\nThe team are already putting plans in place to mass produce the vaccine, even before they know whether it will work.\n\"The aim is to have at least a million doses by about September, once you know the vaccine efficacy results and then move even faster from there,\" said Prof Adrian Hill, who runs the Jenner Institute at Oxford, .\n\"It's pretty clear the world is going to need hundreds of millions of doses, ideally by the end of this year, to end this pandemic, to lead us out of lockdown. \nHe described a million doses as a \"fairly modest target\" and vaccines as \"the exit strategy\" for coronavirus.\nThe researchers hope to know if their vaccine is effective in the next few months.\nHowever, the success of lockdown could prove a stumbling block, as if the number of coronavirus cases fall, then it will take longer to know whether the vaccine is effective. \nThere are discussions about whether it would be safe to deliberately infect people in order to get answers faster. \nThe government has created a coronavirus taskforce to support the rapid development and manufacture of a vaccine. \nBusiness Secretary Alok Sharma said a vaccine was a \"colossal undertaking\" and there \"are no guarantees\".\n\"But the government is backing our scientists, betting big to maximise the chance of success,\" he said. \nIt is funding 21 new research projects and is working to scale up manufacturing so a vaccine could be produced in mass quantities.\nChief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, who will lead the taskforce, said it was important to remember that the successful vaccine could come from anywhere. \nSir Patrick said: \"Just to put some realism on vaccine development, each single project does not have a high probability of success.\n\"So although everyone goes out with great enthusiasm and we hope they work, it's never the case that you know you've got a vaccine that's going to work.\"\nIt remains the view of scientists advising the UK government and of the World Health Organization that 12-18 months is a more realistic timescale for a vaccine."}

You get to the end of the day and they have had a lovely time - but it is amazing how much you can cram into one day, that's for sure.\"\nIt's unclear how much help the duke and duchess have when it comes to looking after their children, but they say they are homeschooling Prince Louis and Princess Charlotte themselves during lockdown.\nAnd Prince William sums it up as \"fun\" - prompting a glance from Catherine.\n\"We don't actually tell the children we've actually kept going through the holidays. I feel very mean,\" she says.\n\"Someone gave me some very good advice pre-the holidays to put in some structure. There's a pretty strict routine here at home that's massively helped us all  - just having a bit of routine, [a] bit of normality.

And also you don't want to sort of scare them and make it too overwhelming,\" she says.\n\"I think it is appropriate to acknowledge it in\u2026 age-appropriate ways to try and help them through it, because these are not normal circumstances and they'll definitely pick up on that.\"\nPrince William says the royals are getting used to speaking via video calls without \"dropping the computer halfway through\".\n\"It gets a bit hectic, I'm not going to lie, with a two-year-old you have to take the phone away,\" Catherine says.\nWilliam adds: \"He always wants to press the red button.\"\nKate laughs. \"It's quite hectic for them all to say the right thing at the right time without pressing the wrong buttons. But it's great and it's nice to keep in touch with everybody.\"\nPrince William also speaks about how he felt anxious for his father, Prince Charles, when \n\"I have to admit, at first I was quite concerned, he fits the profile of somebody, at the age he is at, which is fairly risky,\" he says.\nBut he says Prince Charles has experienced many chest infections and colds before, so he felt optimistic he would recover.\nHe adds that his father found not being able to go for walks challenging, and that the family is doing \"everything we can\" to protect his grandparents, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh.\nWilliam jokes that running around after the children has kept them busy - but says they haven't done as much exercise as they would have liked.\n\"We've been for the odd walk, the odd bike ride as well. So we keep the children busy and active and healthy,\" he says.\n\"We haven't quite done the Joe Wicks workout that everyone else seems to be doing although we are not far off. That might happen at some point.\"\nWilliam says he thinks a reduction in travel around the world will have made a \"huge difference\" to the environment. And he hopes that, once the pandemic eases, businesses will choose to hold more meetings by video, rather than face-to-face.\n\"I've always thought that was lunacy, really\u2026 Why on Earth we do that when we've got the technology nowadays to do things? Why don't we conduct more business at home?\" he asks.\nHe acknowledges that many businesses rely on face-to-face meetings, but hopes that more people will challenge their attitudes to travel after the lockdown ends.\nThe duke and duchess say the lockdown has given them time to focus on relationships with friends and family.\nPrince William says he knows there will be a lot of people in \"very different circumstances\" where \"a lot people are living in one house and... getting on top of each other\".\n\"For the vast majority of people, I hope we could take positives out of this and realise that\u2026 we won't get this whole time again,\" he says.\n\"Honestly, it is stashed in every little corner around the house,\" says Catherine."}

Coronavirus isn't staying in one place so why should BBC Ouch? We're going round the world with two fabulous women to find out how everybody else is coping in this weird situation. A heads up: We're going to talk disability, Aussie slang and what to do with your guide dog when you get a brand new cat during a lockdown. All will be revealed. I'm Emma Tracey, I'm blind, and I moved from Ireland to the UK 15 years ago. And we've got Lee Kumatat. \nLEE -Hi, Emma. I am also blind and I am speaking to you from my living room in San Francisco.\nEMMA -And we've got Holly Lane.\nHOLLY - Hi, Emma. I'm talking to you from Perth in Australia. I have cerebral palsy and I'm currently sat in my lovely study with my lovely dog, Marmite.\nEMMA -Oh, a dog. Very good. It's all about animals today. Holly, let's start with you, and being a disabled person in the time of Coronavirus in Australia.\nHOLLY -Well, first of all I live in Perth which is the most isolated city in Australia. Our borders are shut to the rest of Australia so if you want to come here from the Northern Territory or South Australia, terribly sorry, unless you're a resident you can't actually come in. It's actually been quite useful. Because we've been able to sort of cut ourselves off it's meant that the number of people that have been affected with the virus in this state has been lower than the other states, at the moment. Cross fingers. \nLEE -I did smile when you said we've shut all our borders. I'm like, well you know what, you Western Australians don't really like the eastern seaboard as much anyway, right? So an excuse to keep them out.\nHOLLY -No, exactly! There are some advantages to being so isolated.\nEMMA -There are some advantages, but I'd imagine there are some disadvantages too during this time.\nHOLLY -Yeah, I mean I started working from home on 18th March. The culture here for working from home isn't as established as the UK, so that was kind of interesting. And also I live in Perth, that means that I can get various things, but if I was living in rural Australia that has many challenges to accessing healthcare, being able to get your food, being able to get your medicines, being able to go to the pharmacy. That kind of thing.\nEMMA -How are other disabled Australians coping during the lockdown, and what are you calling it?\nHOLLY - We're not really locked down, we're sort of confined. We haven't officially hit that point of where we can't go out for a walk yet. What you've got to remember is, Western Australia, it's a very, very big state, so if you're living in the country and you're needing to access your health, your doctors, your hospital appointments, anything like that, at the moment it's a big challenge because what they've done is they've restricted travel between certain regions within the state to cut down the chances of Coronavirus getting into rural communities or indigenous communities in particular. They can't come to Perth for their routine check-ups, so there's a risk of things getting missed, conditions not being diagnosed. \nI mean, what I will say here is they have got a real good handle on telehealth, which is doctor's appointments by phone. You can receive your prescriptions by email. So that system, because of the distances that are involved, is a really, really well thought out service. One of the bigger issues that is coming up is around personal protective equipment. \nAlso, the issues with people with learning disabilities. While they have assistance in maybe managing their shopping lists and their day to day lives, the isolation and the social distancing elements have been causing a few problems. But the biggest issue is mental health and people being able to access the services. But they're doing a lot more teleconferencing, like everybody else, but there isn't the sort of face to face stuff available. \nEMMA -And Holly, you've got cerebral palsy and you use two walking sticks. How has your disability affected how you manage?\nHOLLY -Well it's interesting. I had to point out to my manager actually that walking with sticks, I'm always touching stuff. If I don't have hold of my sticks I've got to hold onto something else. So no matter how many times I wash my hands I'm always going to run that higher risk. And getting stuff from the supermarket and all of that kind of malarkey has been kind of interesting. In Australia now they've nominated particular times of the week that people can go shopping if they're vulnerable, because we went a bit bonkers over toilet rolls.\nEMMA -It sounds very like the UK to be honest. Lee, you're in San Francisco. What Holly's saying, does that ring true for you as well? How are things there?\nLEE -San Francisco, it went quite early. It was the earliest city to go into lockdown. They call it shelter in place. So my employer decided to close our offices on Friday 13th and so we all kind of scrambled to grab our stuff so that we could work from home. And then on the following Tuesday they went into shelter in place. And they gave people about ten hours to get sorted. So that was quite interesting. I was very lucky, I had a work colleague who came around and took me shopping. I mean, the line was incredible. \nBut what was really interesting was that even though we knew that this was all coming people weren't social distancing, and certainly the shops weren't set up for it. So now they've got markers on the floor to make sure that people stay six feet apart. If you can see them of course. So I found myself feeling quite panicky because I didn't have very much in my freezer and I thought, well I don't know how long this is going to go on for. I don't know what access I'm going to have to online shopping because presumably everybody else is going to be doing that. I sort of went into a bit of a shopping frenzy and bought anything I could. Is there any ice cream? I don't care what flavour it is. I mean, why ice cream seemed important at that time I don't know, but it did. It was a really weird time.\nEMMA -Well, that must have been really scary for you because you're quite new to San Francisco.\nLEE -Yes, I arrived on 2nd January to start an entirely new job and a new career on 6th January, moved into my apartment on 10th January. But I didn't have any of my belongings around me because I shipped them from the UK. They left the UK on December 30th. I seem to remember these dates very clearly in my head, they seem to be etched into my brain. So I kind of lived for nearly three months without my things around me. I had a couple of garden chairs, a blow up mattress and I eventually bought a couple of bar stools and a bed. So it has been a fairly exhausting time. It's a job that is very full on. Can I give them a plug? Because you know what Americans are like, they love a plug.\nEMMA - Yeah.\nLEE -I've joined LightHouse for the Blind and Visually Impaired in San Francisco as their Director of Communication after working at the BBC. So it was a totally full on change of job, change of culture, change of work culture. I moved in to San Francisco city, so I'm about a mile and a half away from my work. So I was determined that I was going to walk to work so I had the kind of initial learning how to get anywhere, plus learning how to deal with traffic on the wrong side of the road, and also dealing with\u2026 One of the things that's been really quite confronting for me is dealing with the very large centralised homeless population.\nEMMA -Yes, so how, as a blind person with a guide dog, how are you navigating the homelessness situation?\nLEE -You never know who you're asking directions from, and when you're new to a city you're asking directions from everybody. A lot of the homeless population have dogs that are not on leads. My first day in the office and my first task was to address an all staff meeting, so 150 people, and I was late for the meeting because the Uber had dropped me where I hadn't expected the Uber to drop me and I got out of the Uber and had to find where I was, and of course the GPS wasn't giving me any help at the time. And I asked somebody, \"Is this the crossing?\" \"Oh, I'll help you, I'll help you. Here's the crossing. You are so beautiful. If I had a woman like you I would just be so happy,\" and then he started to stroke my hair and I was like, okay. \nAnd I think I was just so focused on getting to that meeting that I just compartmentalised it, put it away somewhere and didn't really think about it, and so it wasn't until a couple of weeks later that I was relaying this to somebody that they went, \"You're joking.\" I thought, well yeah, that was pretty bad wasn't it? It is very, very confronting. I was so looking forward to coming to work in a city, being able to go out and do the city stuff and walk the city blocks with the dog, but actually you just feel like you're running a gauntlet. So at the moment I just sort of run outside, take the dog for a quick wee and run back inside again. \nEMMA -Well, while you're on animals, Holly has a dog, you have a dog, what's it like trying to keep a dog entertained and exercised and all that during this strange time?\nLEE - It's okay. I've been so lucky. I don't know about you, Holly, but I've got a dog park two blocks away from my apartment and so I do take her up there. The biggest challenge is keeping her work up so she's my guide dog. I am really lucky actually. On my first day in San Francisco I met a very nice man who saw me waiting three changes of lights and not being able to cross the road and he came over to talk to me, and he's got a Doberman called Grace and my dog's called Frankie. Yeah, I know. \nEMMA -Grace and Frankie, the well-known TV show. One of my favourites actually.\nLEE -I know, I couldn't believe it, I went, \"Oh my god, Grace and Frankie.\" He very kindly said, \"Please use my number. Give me your number, I live only a couple of blocks away from you,\" and I thought, no way you weirdo. Anyway, it turns out he wasn't a weirdo and he very kindly checked in with me just by text. And we met up and he's lovely and he takes my Frankie walking for me whenever I'm sort of snowed under. So it could be worse.\nEMMA -What about you, Holly?\nHOLLY -I have a Tibetan Terrier and his name is Marmite.\nLEE -Why didn't you call him Vegemite?\nEMMA -Is he a love him or hate him sort of dog?\nHOLLY -The reason he's called Marmite is he's got like a ginger beard, the rest of him is black. But he thinks all of his Christmases have come at once since I've been working from home. I'm really lucky because I've got a park 500 meters from my front door so we can take him down there and he can gallivant. And the locals are pretty nice, because I need exercise every day to keep me fit and healthy, so I try and go down and have a walk around before I start work in the mornings now. There's quite a few locals that I'm starting to get to know, because obviously previously I haven't been around. We do the social distancing hi thing. I can go down on my buggy and take the balls down and we go and let off some steam because I've actually got two dogs, I've got Marmite and I've got Stacey who's a Staffie.\nEMMA -Because I was going to say, with two excitable dogs and two walking sticks that sounds a bit of a nightmare, but you have a buggy that you use for dog walks. \nHOLLY -Yes, it's easier, much, much easier and much safer. \nEMMA -Lee, how are you with the social distancing?\nLEE -Really bad. Terrible. It's really interesting trying to watch people communicate with you when you can't tell they're there because they're more than six feet away and they can't catch your eye. And I've found that people just aren't saying hello, whereas they were saying hello before we were social distancing. San Franciscans are very friendly generally speaking, people would just come up and talk, and they sort of guess that if they stand close to you you're going to know that they're there, but they can't do that. \nAnd I've been in a couple of situations where people have freaked out because I've stood too close to them not knowing that they're there. That's been a bit scary for me, and my default really response is to get a bit defensive and say, \"Well, I didn't know you were there.\" And then I think, well actually their response is instinctive now as well and so I haven't yet worked out a good way to respond to that yet.\nEMMA -Well, I know for me tears would spring to my eyes, like it's that upsetting for someone to get annoyed with you through absolutely no fault of your own, and something you cannot help and something you couldn't have helped and something you're probably going to do again in five minutes, you know?\nLEE -Yeah, exactly. I mean, I do find that Americans are a little bit better about being direct, you know, \"Ma'am, I'm trying to get past.\" And you go, \"Okay, well I didn't know.\" But they don't seem to take offence at you saying, \"Well I'm sorry, I didn't know,\" they sort of see that as a fact rather then you being defensive. So what feels to me like me snapping actually to them is a fairly usual interaction. There are some times when people will walk past me in the street and I think woah mate, get over to your side of the pavement. \nI've got a very long cane I use so that when Frankie's running in the park I take my cane, and the Americans love, well a certain group, the National Federation of the Blind, they love a good long cane, right? It's got to be up to your head or it's no good. And I'm only five foot two so my cane really is about five feet long, and so I kind of stick it out in front of me and imagine, are they more than one foot further from the end of my cane? And so that's how I'm measuring my social distance. \nEMMA - What is the long cane about anyway?\nLEE -I think it's about speed, because you have more time to react if you happen to walk into an obstacle. I just think it gives you more cane to get tangled up in when you do walk into an obstacle. I'm not sure I'm coming round to it yet but when I'm in the park and I'm just wandering around I'm happy to take my five foot massive long stick and point it at people and say, \"Get back.\"\nEMMA -So we need to talk about the cat. You are brand new to San Francisco, you're working in a busy new job, you've already got a dog, you've just adopted a cat. \nLEE -Yeah? And what's your point? [laughs] Well, you know, in for a penny, in for a pound, in for a dollar. I've always wanted a cat. I'm probably in the best place I've been since leaving Australia in 2008 to get one. I live in quite a spacious one bedroom apartment. She's going to be an indoor cat. And I'm home a lot, and I thought well, it's a good time to do it. I must admit I'm a little bit surprised it's happened so quickly, I kind of had the idea on a Monday and had the cat on a Friday. [bell tinkles] There she is, she's ringing her bell for you.\nEMMA -Oh, that's the bell. \nLEE -Yeah, there she is. There's Pip.\nEMMA -Well timed. So how's it going with Pip and the guide dog, Frankie, then?\nLEE -Well, Frankie's had a couple of extra meals on Pip, because they tell you to keep them in one room and I had Pip set up in my walk in closet. She's now kind of coming out and using the whole of the apartment and I forgot to pick up the food. So Frankie's had a couple of meals. They are getting on fine, the cat doesn't seem terribly worried by Frank. Frank would like to chase the cat a little bit, he kind of does that doggie play bow thing and the cat goes, I don't know what you mean, I'm going to run away.\nSo I think they'll be absolutely fine, but I did have a scare last night. Pip, whenever she kind of gets over stimulated she hides, and I hadn't heard Pip's bell for a couple of hours and I thought I wonder where she is? And I started to move the furniture around. I couldn't find her anywhere and I thought maybe she's lost her bell. Maybe she's got caught somewhere. And I then thought, she's not here. And then I thought, oh no, I'd taken out the kitty litter and put it down the garbage shoot which is only 12 feet away from my apartment but she must have just got past me. Anyway, I rang my mum. Why I rang my mum in Sydney, Australia, I have no idea, but I rang my mum and she said, \"What are you going to do?\" I said, \"I don't know. I don't know if she's here, I don't know where she is,\" and I was really panicking. She said, \"Ring Denis.\" \nNow Denis is a man who's been wonderful to me. He's up on the third floor and he's helped me get rid of boxes and he's just been really nice. Anyway, quarter to 11 last night I ring Denis and I say, \"Hey, Denis.\" He's like, \"Hey,\" he sounds really sleepy. And I said to him, \"Were you asleep?\" \"Ah, fading,\" he said to me. I said, \"I can't find my cat,\" and he went, \"I'll be right there.\"\nEMMA -Oh!\nLEE -He's just amazing. So I waited for a little bit and I thought I wonder where he is, and anyway I heard footsteps coming along and he knocks and I open my front door and he said to me, \"You've got to get a gate.\" And he hands me my cat.\nEMMA -Oh! Where was the cat?\nLEE -She was outside his flat. \nEMMA -Oh, and does she know Denis?\nLEE -Never met him before in her life.\nEMMA -Wow. Are you sure it's the right cat?\nLEE -Yes. She's mine, she's my little Pip.\nEMMA -All cats feel the same to me. \nLEE -Well because Pip's got someone else's tail. She's a little bit long haired but her tail is extremely fluffy and so that's how I knew it was her. And she was very pleased to see me. So hence, I've been awake all night with a cat who's like, oh my god I'm back, oh my god, what's that noise? Oh my god I'm back. So I'm a little bit tired.\nI echo what Holly was saying really about this whole horrible, horrible situation but just trying to find a silver lining really. It's given me a chance to be here and be in my community a little bit. A lady in the park made me a homemade mask and it's given me a sense of my place in the city that I think would have taken longer. \nEMMA - She made you a homemade mask?\nLEE -Yes, facemask. \nEMMA -What is it like?\nLEE -Well, she made it out of an old cushion cover. So this is Anita who I met. Dogs are a great way of introducing you to people and she's got a poodle called Polly, Polly poodle, and she got laid off from her job. And to keep herself busy that's what she's been doing, she loves to sew and she's been making masks for people. And I said, \"Oh, would you make me one?\" She said, \"Yeah, of course.\" So the next day I go out to the park and there she is, and we're all walking around with the same coloured kind of masks on, these kind of burnt orange patterned face masks. We must look like we belong to a cult or something. We're all kind of socially distanced walking with our dogs around the park. \nEMMA -You guys are all wearing face masks?\nLEE -A lot of people are, yes. Certainly all the people that you deal with in shops and services.\nHOLLY -Same here. A lot of people now are starting to wear masks. A few weeks ago not at all, and now people are starting to wear masks when they're out in public. It's quite interesting for me. The changes that have happened over the last month or so, you know, people working from home. And I'm just hopeful that these changes stay. I know with my job there were some reservations as to whether I could do the whole of my job from home, and it's turned out I can, whereas before they weren't quite so online. I think this need has presented opportunities as much as restricted some things.\nEMMA - Holly, is it quite tricky for you to get to work sometimes and to go into work all the time? Is that something that your impairment makes it more difficult to do?\nHOLLY -It takes me an hour, and I work right in the centre of town. So what's so nice for me at the moment is that I'm getting between two to three hours back of my day. And because obviously cerebral palsy, when you're staggering about on sticks all day you get more tired. So being able to have that quality time back is an unexpected benefit.\nLEE -And so are you finding that you've got more energy and what are you doing with that energy?\nHOLLY -It's things like being able to go and go for a dog walk or potter about in my garden. Cook a proper dinner rather than get something out of the freezer.\nLEE -Cooking is something that I'm doing as well. Like with everything being new I'd come home and just shove a microwave dinner in the microwave and that's it. I didn't have any energy to do anything else. And now I seem to be working more and I'm finding working online and just doing the kind of remote meeting thing quite exhausting, but it's mentally exhausting not physically exhausting, and actually I'm finding that cooking is my commute if you like. So it's providing that divider, that distance between work and leisure. And I'm loving it.\nHOLLY -It's an unexpected benefit, I wasn't expecting to have the energy because normally I don't. \nLEE -It's really interesting though that you seem to have established a routine, Holly, because I have absolutely not established any kind of routine. One day I can wake up at seven, one day I can wake up at 3 am, one day I can wake up at nine. And one day I didn't wake up till 11 and was 20 minutes late to a very important meeting and people were sending out search parties. I'm just all over the place in terms of routine. So what's your secret?\nHOLLY -I've had a couple of occasions where like I've fallen over and injured myself, and I have been at home for like a chunk of time. And I did struggle with my mental health when that was happening. So when they said right, you've got to work from home I thought oh, okay, well I want to set up some kind of routine that makes sure that I get my exercise. \nBecause the other thing that I was worried about was losing my mobility and putting on a load of weight. I was like, well I have to set something up here so that I know that I'm doing all of the things that I can to keep myself fit. So it's sort of happened by accident. My partner starts work fairly early, so he starts work at seven in the morning. Because I get woken up by that it means that I've got this time to sort of set myself up for the day. \nLEE -I wonder whether having other people in the house does help, because I'm here on my own, and I think that fitting in with someone else's rhythm can help. The dog will just let me sleep. I'm not sure the cat will. \nEMMA -On living on your own, I find that living life blind involves a hundred strategies but also thousands of like little connections and knowledge about where you can buy stuff. I've been where I am for four and a half years and I've a lot of things I can call on and pull from. How are you getting all your food and who are you asking for help? It feels to me like it would be very tricky, but you seem very chilled to be honest.\nLEE -I feel really chilled. I have a very good corner store, they're keeping a lot of supplies up and they're very happy for me to stay put and I tell them what I want and they bring it to me. Although I'm finding being in stores and having to touch stuff to identify whether it's actually the thing I want becoming increasingly more stressful. It's those incidental things that you don't necessarily know are coming that you touch that you think ooh. So I'm doing okay with that. I divide my shopping between Amazon and Instacart over here. \nHOLLY -Well that's funny because it's different here. So because I'm known as a vulnerable person I suppose I was able to fill in a form and I gave them my Blue Badge or ACROD pass number because I had to prove that I was disabled, and then once they'd reviewed the form they texted me and they said, yeah, you're fine, you get first pick of the slots. \nEMMA -We have that here. I spent a couple of days trying to get through to a couple of supermarkets and now I'm on a vulnerable list. It's funny how you suddenly don't mind being vulnerable isn't it? [laughter] So I get the first pick of the slots as well. Holly, just to finish on a very serious, not serious note, you'll know this as well, Lee, Aussies are great for the old slang aren't they? What Coronavirus slang is there?\nHOLLY -So you're not in isolation, you're in iso. They tend to shorten everything. Scott Morrison is our Prime Minister so he's ScoMo. \nLEE -And if it's short it gets lengthened. You know, my name's Lee but they could never just stick with Lee, I always got called something else like Lee B or Leonine. It just had to be lengthened. They just don't like to conform, the Aussies. I can say that, I'm Australian. \nEMMA -So I've heard that sanitiser is now sanny?\nHOLLY -Yeah, that's right, yeah.\nEMMA -Love it. Lee, you have picked up some Americanisms already?\nLEE -Ah no. I haven't said reach out in this conversation though have I? I mean, I hate it.\nEMMA -No, but you did say garbage shoot.\nLEE -What else would it be?\nEMMA -Rubbish?\nLEE -Okay. But I didn't say trash. Then it would be really American. \nEMMA -Fab. Well, thank you for being fabulous, ladies. It's been really, really interesting to hear about your different takes on this time of Coronavirus in your respective countries and it's been really great to hear all your stories. Thank you very much.\nLEE - Thank you. Stay well everybody. \nHOLLY -Take care. \nEMMA -That's a wrap for this global edition of the Cabin Fever podcast.

The crisis has resulted in extra pressure on services that support the most vulnerable: the elderly, disabled and homeless.\nAt the same time income from fees and charges has dried up, and there's fear that council tax revenues may fall as people face financial hardship.\nAt the start of this crisis, council leaders said they largely felt reassured by government promises of support. Now - with so much demand on the Treasury - there's scepticism about how much more funding will be forthcoming.\nLocal government, which often feels like a forgotten frontline service, wants to ensure its voice is heard among the calls for support. Hence this stark warning about the potential consequences for crucial services if it doesn't get more cash. \nThe LGA says councils are spending more on helping disabled, older and homeless people through the crisis, but leisure and planning services at many town halls have been scaled back or closed, meaning income has \"dried up\".\nRichard Watts, chairman of the LGA's resources board, said: \"Additional funding is urgently needed to help councils get through this crisis, support the vulnerable and adapt to life once we defeat this virus, when our local services will be needed more than ever to help communities rebuild. \n\"It would be wrong and unacceptable if councils are then forced to make further cutbacks to the very services that will have helped the nation through this crisis and the key workers who are producing heroics on the front line see their jobs placed at risk.\"\nThe government has announced councils will be able to defer \u00a32.6bn in business rate payments owed to central government.\nA Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said: \"We've already provided \u00a31.6bn of additional funding and have announced new measures to help ease immediate cash flow pressures faced by councils in England.\""}

Some 500 fully-equipped beds, with oxygen and ventilators, are already in place and there is space for another 3,500.\nIf it did reach capacity, it would be one of the largest hospitals in the world.\nEach ward is named after a different British doctor, nurse or other medical professional.\nThe first two wards to open will be named Lady Harriett Acland and Ethel Bedford-Fenwick after two nurses whose work in the 18th and 19th centuries paved the way for modern nursing.\nThe facility, which was officially opened on 3 April, was built with the help of up to 200 soldiers a day from the Royal Anglian Regiment and Royal Gurkha Rifles, working long shifts alongside NHS staff and contractors.\nTimelapse \nArchitects and engineers from BDP, the firm that helped convert the centre, were part of the planning team given the task of creating the life-saving facility.\nBDP Principal James Hepburn said the scale and timeframe for the construction were unlike previous healthcare projects and architects were coming up with designs almost as building needed to get under way.\nThe framework for individual bed bays were made from material usually used to make exhibition stands - because it is lightweight and could be constructed quickly.\nMr Hepburn said the three main challenges were:\nExCeL's existing electrical infrastructure has been modified to ensure the power supply can cope with demand - and not cut out. Temporary generators and oxygen tanks, to supply the beds, have also been installed.\nMr Hepburn said his team has drawn up an \nThe ExCeL centre's suitability for the hospital site goes beyond the functional characteristics of the building. \nIt is served by public transport links. The nearby London City Airport can be used to bring in supplies and equipment and there is also hotel and university accommodation close by - should it be needed.\nIt will be led by a team of eight senior staff, drawn from local hospitals and trusts. At capacity, the hospital will need 16,000 staff to keep it running. That will include thousands of doctors, nurses and volunteers. \n\"The numbers are scary,\" chief operating officer Natalie Forrest said. \"To run one ward, including all of our ancillary staff, we need 200 members of staff.\"\nThe nursing staff is being drawn from other hospitals, as well as volunteers from St John Ambulance. Airline staff from Easyjet and Virgin Atlantic have also been approached. \nCabin crews have security clearance and many of them are also first aid-trained. The NHS says they would be changing beds, helping doctors and nurses on the wards, and performing other non-clinical tasks.\nIt is not a conventional walk-in hospital - only patients already on ventilators will be admitted, transferred from other intensive care units across London. They will stay at the hospital until their course of ventilation is finished.\nSupport services such as pharmacies and therapy treatment are also be available. \nAnd a mortuary is also included in the NHS Nightingale design. Additional mortuary space is also being found elsewhere in the city, including Wanstead Flats in the Manor Park area of Newham, local residents have been told.\nOther temporary morgues are also being set up around the UK, including at an ice rink in Milton Keynes, a crematorium in Ruislip, and at Birmingham Airport, where the hangar facility will initially have space for 1,500 bodies \"but will expand to hold more\".\nWork is already underway to expand the NHS Nightingale-style hospitals beyond London to ease pressures on regional NHS services.\nConference centres in Birmingham, Manchester and Harrogate have been transformed into NHS Nightingale hospitals over the past few weeks to serve the midlands and north of England.\nWork is also underway in Glasgow and at the University of West England (UWE) in Bristol to create temporary emergency hospital sites.\nScotland's emergency facility at the SEC in Glasgow will be named NHS Louisa Jordan, after a nurse who died from typhus while serving in Serbia during an outbreak in 1915.\nBelfast City Hospital's tower block has been transformed into Northern Ireland's first Nightingale hospital - a 230-bed unit staffed by a team drawn from across Northern Ireland.\nAn extra 6,000 beds are also being set up in Wales - many in sports and leisure facilities - to take the pressure off hospitals during the coronavirus pandemic.\nAmong them is the Principality Stadium, in Cardiff, the national stadium of Wales, with capacity for up to 2,000 beds, if needed."}

On Thursday, less than two weeks after the programme's start, the money ran out, overwhelmed by demand.\nThe White House has requested an extra $250bn, but the relief has stalled as Democrats and Republicans in Congress fight over how to target the funds.\nNow millions of business owners across the country are wondering how they will continue.\n\"What I fear the most is not being able to survive,\" says Agatha Kulaga, co-founder of New York bakery Ovenly. \nThe business, which started in her kitchen in 2010, has grown into four shops, 67 employees and some 150 wholesale clients, including major grocers such as Whole Foods. Its fifth location was supposed to open at the city's biggest airport this month.\nBut in March, Ms Kulaga shut her doors and laid off her staff, responding to health concerns and the drop in sales as the state restricted activity to try to slow the spread of the virus. \nShe has since applied to about 20 different aid programmes, including the new federal programme, which offers loans that do not need to be repaid if firms use 75% of the money for paying staff. Companies can re-hire former employees who have been laid off to qualify.\n\"We had serious momentum and when this happened, it's obviously devastating,\" she said.\nAs many as a quarter of small businesses fear they will not be able to survive more than two months of shutdown, according to surveys by the Chamber of Commerce and other organisations.\nSuch failures would dramatically alter the economic landscape in America, where 30 million small businesses employ almost half the country's workforce.\nMain Street America, which represents commercial districts with about 300,000 small firms, found that 7.5 million firms employing more than 35 million people are at risk of failure in the next five months.\n\"Small businesses are really losing faith that the government is going to be able to support them through this crisis,\" says Patrice Frey, the organisation's president. \"That translates into massive job losses and ultimately undermines the strength of the American economy on the other side of this.\"\nWashington, which approved the $349bn in small business loans last month as part of a bigger $2tn relief bill, is well aware it has a crisis on its hands. \nEven before running out of money, the programme - called the Paycheck Protection Program - had faced problems, including delays at some of the banks through which the government is distributing the money and criticism that the money was not reaching the smallest, most needy firms.\nDelays have also beset a separate low-cost loan scheme offered directly by the Small Business Administration through an expansion of a programme created to address disasters like hurricanes.\nThe Federal Reserve has also announced its own \"Main Street\" loan programme. But the central bank's plan, while unprecedented, is expected to reach more mid-size firms, not the small \"mom-and-pop\" shops experts say face such risk.\nThe government and many banks say some problems should be expected given the speed of roll-out. More than 1.6 million loan applications were approved for more than $339bn, the Small Business Administration said. \n\"I think it's really kind of exceptional that the government could move that quickly and that effectively,\" JP Morgan Chase boss Jamie Dimon told reporters this week, when his bank announced it had disbursed more than $9bn of roughly $37bn requested by some 300,000 applicants.\nMs Frey says those defences don't \"change the reality on the ground, which is these businesses are on the edge and unless they receive more relief immediately and with fewer hoops to jump through, these businesses are simply going to dissolve.\"\nNew Yorker Fonda Sara, who has run the Zuzu's Petals flower shop in Brooklyn for more than 40 years, is one of the people still waiting for a response from her bank about the pay cheque protection programme.\nBut even if she is ultimately approved for funds to cover wages for herself and another full-time staffer, Ms Sara says the help will do little to offset her losses as rent, utilities and other bills pile up while she misses out on spring - typically her busiest season. \n\"No matter what financial aid I get from the city and the federal government, it will never be enough to sustain me or restore me,\" she says.\n\"The only thing that will help me is if when I reopen my sales return to the state they were in before the shutdown and honestly no one knows if that will happen.\"\nMs Kulaga, who is waiting for funds after being approved for a $410,000 pay cheque protection loan, said the rules for how the money should be spent - quickly and primarily on wages  - means that it will be of limited use to companies like hers, which have already cut workers and don't know when they will be able to re-open. \nThe 40-year-old says she has considered re-hiring so that her staff receive the benefits, but \"if we are not re-opened in eight weeks they would have to be laid off again and have to reapply for unemployment benefits.\" Meanwhile, the company's other expenses are mounting.\nWhile laying off staff was \"a difficult decision, it was one... that was required in order to preserve our cash... so that we can actually survive while we are closed and also be prepared to re-open when the time comes,\" she says.\n\"I hope that we can reopen and I do believe that we can, but, at the same time the threat is real,\" she says."}

Algeria, Egypt and Morocco have all had more than 2,000 cases and at least 100 deaths. Algeria has had the most deaths, with 348.\nElsewhere, South Africa has also had more than 2,000 cases, with 48 deaths, while the continent's most populous nation, Nigeria, has had 442 cases and 13 confirmed deaths out of a population of some 200 million.\nGet the latest on \nWHO Africa director Dr Matshidiso Moeti told BBC Global Health correspondent Tulip Mazumdar that international travel played a part.\n\"If you look at the proportion of people who travel, Africa has fewer people who are travelling internationally,\" she said.\nBut now that the virus is in within Africa, she says that her organisation is acting under the assumption that it will spread just as quickly as elsewhere.\nThe WHO has witnessed the virus spreading from big cities to \"the hinterland\" in South Africa, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Cameroon and Ghana, Dr Moeti said.\nThere are around 15 African countries where the virus has not spread far so, if these countries adopt strong social distancing measures, they could contain the virus, she added.\nSince the first case was reported in Africa, most of those infected have been concentrated in urban areas where health facilities and access to care is in close proximity. \nThis cannot be said of rural areas where treatment facilities are scarce or non-existent. \nThe fragile health infrastructure in the continent means that it will be doubly strained by an increasing number of new Covid-19 infections. \nIf the experiences of countries like Italy, Spain, France and the US are anything to go by, then Africa will struggle to manage an increasing number of people suffering from the virus especially those who need critical care. \nHealthcare workers in different parts of the continent have complained about the lack of adequate personal protective equipment. \nCovid-19 is a highly infectious disease and healthcare workers are at a higher risk of infection.  \nTunisia already has 68 healthcare works infected, Liberia has 18 while Niger is reporting 32. \nProvisional projections from the WHO suggest that more than 10 million people could be infected in the next 3-6 months, but that figure doesn't take into account public health measures that are being put in place. \nIf Covid-19 is able to take hold on the continent, the consequences could be far more devastating than we've seen in Europe and the US, says our global health correspondent.\nThe WHO says there are only around five intensive care beds available for every one million people in most African countries, compared with around 4,000 beds for every million people in Europe. \nDr Moeti said the WHO was focusing on prevention rather than treating the virus, because many African countries don't have the capacity to treat many coronavirus patients. \n\"We want to minimise the proportion of people who get to the point of needing critical care in an ICU, because we know that these types of facilities are not adequate by any means in the majority of African countries,\" she said.\nDr Moeti said the lack of ventilators was \"one of the biggest challenges\" that African countries are facing.\nFor patients critically ill with Covid-19, access to a ventilator could be a matter of life or death.\nThe machines get oxygen into the lungs and remove carbon dioxide from the body when people are too sick to breathe on their own.\nOne of the first recorded deaths from coronavirus in Africa was Zimbabwean journalist Zororo Makamba in March.\nThe local authorities in the capital, Harare, said that they did not have a ventilator to treat him.\nDr Moeti pinpointed a few key things countries need to do:\nSeveral countries have enforced lockdowns.\nIn some countries, schools are been turned into healthcare facilities where people can be quarantined and even offered care. \nTextile industries have been recalibrated to start manufacturing personal protective equipment such as medical gowns.\nEarlier this week the UN Food Programme started distributing badly needed equipment around the continent from a new hub in Ethiopia's Bole airport.\nThe cargo included one million face masks, personal protective equipment, and ventilators. \nAnd the Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention has announced that it will roll out one million coronavirus testing kits to meet the continent's \"big gap\".\nThe organisation's director "}

Germany says using its app will be voluntary.\nDenmark is set to release an app in the next few weeks developed by Netcompany - which employs nearly 400 people in the UK. It will use Bluetooth to detect contact with people within one to two metres. The company says authorities will only be able to access the data on an aggregated and pseudo-anonymised level - making tracing an individual impossible, the firm says.\nIn Italy, development of a national contact-tracing app has been outsourced to Milan-based app-maker Bending Spoons. The plan is to test the tracing app in some regions before rolling it out nationwide, although no timeline has been set.\nThe start-up, which has made fitness, sleep and gaming apps, was chosen from hundreds of applicants.\nIt is also part of the Pan-European Privacy Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT) initiative, which is attempting to create a system which will work across national borders while preserving as much privacy and security as possible. German officials have also backed the initiative.\nThe idea is that a person travelling from one European country to another would still be able to receive or trigger an alert, whichever national tracing app they are using.\nThe records, gathered by Bluetooth, would be stored in an anonymous, encrypted form, PEPP-PT said in a briefing earlier this month.\n\"Even if the data stored in the country data centres is subpoenaed or a hacker steals it, there is no way to trace back the patients or the contact people,\" said Chris Boos, one of the project's co-ordinators.\nThat is important due to the massive scale at which the app needs to be deployed to be most effective.\nSingapore's implementation of the TraceTogether app was reportedly adopted by only 10%-20% of the population.\nAustralian officials say that they will need at least 40% of people to use their app for it to be effective. \nOther experts say that 60% of the population must install the app, and \nConcerns about the potential for abuse by national authorities and intelligence agencies have led to bodies like PEPP-PT backing an anonymised approach using Bluetooth.\nIn April, Apple and Google announced they were working together to create a platform that could be used by the various national apps.\nGoogle develops the Android mobile operating system, while Apple makes iOS for the iPhone. \nTogether, Android and iOS software powers a majority of smartphones on the planet.\nMr Boos of PEPP-PT said the collaboration seemed to be a good idea, although there were several points to discuss,\n\"Google and Apple are very open in these decisions, and there's no point in getting up-in-arms,\" he said.

However, it opened again on the Monday.\nThe Peak District remains open, but the park authority is urging people not to visit during the Easter break \nVisitors have also been told not to travel to the Lake District, and police have stopped some people attempting to go there.\nSnowdonia National Park in north Wales closed off access to its busiest mountains, while car parks have been closed at some Scottish beauty spots.\nPeople around the UK are currently being advised to only leave their homes for the following reasons:\nOfficial guidance now states exercise should be done at home if you or any others in your household have potential symptoms of coronavirus.\nThe government has said it is not going to stop outdoor exercise otherwise, but has renewed warnings against sunbathing during the current restrictions.\nOn 16 April, police guidance was published about what constitutes a reasonable excuse for leaving your home. The guidance, which mainly applies to England, lists driving to the countryside for a walk as \"reasonable\" if \"far more time\" is spent walking than driving.\nBut it adds that driving for a \"prolonged period with only brief exercise\" is not reasonable. \nIt also says a person is allowed to stop for a break in exercise. However short periods of exercise followed by long periods of inactivity are not permitted (so a short walk followed by a period of sunbathing would not be permitted). \nIt appears more people are going to the parks than at the start of the lockdown. \nTrips to parks and beaches on 5 April, the second Sunday of lockdown, were 29% lower than normal \nBut the previous Sunday they were 52% lower than normal, suggesting the number of trips were creeping back up.\nThe government is concerned people might pass the virus between themselves in parks, \nDeputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries said: \"If you are sitting on a park bench, people tend to accumulate. It is very difficult to prevent that.\"\nProf John Edmunds, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, explains there were three ways that the virus may be transmitted:\n\"The first two of these routes would be reduced to virtually zero out of doors,\" he said. \"You are much less likely to touch an infected surface, and suspended particles will be massively diluted by the fresh air.\"\nThat means that the remaining danger is droplet infection. To try to avoid that people should stay at least the recommended 2m (6ft) distance from others. However, \nThe government's current concern is that crowded parks and people sitting on benches could mean that people are not staying far enough apart, and so there is a danger of infection.\nIf outdoor exercise was stopped, it would be a particular problem for people without access to a garden.\nLabour's new deputy leader Angela Rayner said it was \"all right for people who have got big houses and huge back gardens\" to tell people sunbathing while observing social distancing to stop doing so.\nAnd Linda Bauld, professor of public health at University of Edinburgh, said: \"The health implications of the lockdown that we anticipate - increased alcohol consumption, domestic violence, anxiety and depression, poor diet and decreased physical activity - will get worse if we confine more of us to our homes, without the hugely important respite that outdoor exercise provides.\"\n\"If the rationale is virus transmission outdoors, then far stronger evidence is needed to justify it.\"\nCarl Heneghan, professor of evidence-based medicine at University of Oxford, \nHe also stressed that people with other health conditions do much worse with the virus, and if people stop exercising they are more likely to have other conditions.\n\"If the government is going to stop outdoor exercise then it is stopping responding to evidence,\" he said."}

This discussion was meant to take place face to face at the IMF's annual meetings in Washington DC. But for obvious reasons, those meetings became virtual, as did my interview with her.\nFirst up, a refreshing admission. Just three months ago, the IMF's January economic forecast update projected that the base unit of living standards - the per person size of the economy or GDP per capita - would be going up in 160 countries. That would have meant 82% of nations becoming better off in 2020. \nNow, in April, because of Covid-19, she says: \"We are projecting 170 countries to see income per capita shrinking during 2020\" - 87% of the atlas of the world. \nAnd yet this detail - which is part of a broader forecast that sees world GDP dive 3% in 2020, creating \"a global recession we have not seen in our lifetimes\" - may not be the end of it. \n\"I want to stress this may be actually a more optimistic picture than reality produces,\" Ms Georgieva told the BBC.\n\"Epidemiologists are now helping us making macroeconomic projections. Never in the history of the IMF have we had that. And what they're telling us is that the novel coronavirus is a big unknown, and we don't know whether it may return in 2021.\"\nIt is small wonder that the IMF is in rescue mode. The organisation traditionally tasked with being a fiscal watchdog and ambulance for the world now has a rather different message - that the priority everywhere has to be lives and livelihoods. \n\"It is the time that governments should spend as much as they can afford and more, but keep the receipts. We don't want to lose accountability and transparency during this crisis,\" Ms Georgieva says. \n\"We will see some countries being able to do more, and actually, the UK has already done quite a lot. And we will see some countries that will need more help because they have much more limited capacity to act. And this is where the IMF and other international financial institutions come into play.\"\nIn these times of ultra-low interest rates, she says, the IMF can help countries to get more ammunition to fight the health crisis, but also to deal with the economic fallout.\n\"We need to target support to the most vulnerable people in the most vulnerable parts of the economy,\" Ms Georgieva says. \nInterventions now will help spur a rapid bounce-back in growth and reduce permanent economic scars. But despite the depth and breadth of the downturn, she is very cautious about prematurely lifting shutdowns around the world.\n\"Saving lives and saving livelihoods go hand in hand with stopping the pandemic. We simply cannot restart the economy to the fullest, and without restarting the economy, finance ministers are not going to have the revenues they need, including for their health services,\" Ms Georgieva says. \n\"So we have to, of course, listen to the health professionals and design protocols that allow us over time to reopen segments of the economy and do that cautiously. We have to then carefully calibrate how we're doing this reopening.\" \nShe suggests that automated factories and rural areas might be easier to reopen, but there is still some \"figuring out\" to do around reopening busy cities and towns.\nMs Georgieva warns against what has been dubbed \"pandemic protectionism\", where some advanced countries have sat on medical equipment and pharmaceutical supplies for use domestically. \n\"It's a very simple message - you cannot beat the virus unless you beat it everywhere. When one country is suffering from an epidemic, then it makes sense to be protective and keep what the country needs domestically. \n\"But when we are all hit by an epidemic... we need to act together. And we would very much encourage countries to actually integrate their capabilities rather than trying to keep it each one for itself.\"\nBut her central message is to look beyond the understandable concern for what is happening in the world's advanced nations, to the problems facing poorer ones. The G20's decision to suspend debt repayments from the world's most deprived countries was a start, but she says we must remain mindful. \n\"Poor countries in the world are hit multiple times. They're hit by the the pandemic. They're hit by the spillover from economic contraction elsewhere. They're hit by the flight to safety,\" Ms Georgieva says.\n\"$100bn has left emerging markets in developing countries just in two months, much more than during the global financial crisis. They're hit because remittances are drying up. And those that are commodity exporters are hit by prices of their exports dropping.\" \nShe says \"lifelines\" are needed now for such countries, such as the debt standstill which would free billions for health services. \"We need each other. It is a moment testing our humanity and being together acting with solidarity. We will get to the other side of this.\" "}

China has recorded 4,632 deaths - including an extra 1,290 deaths announced on Friday in the city of Wuhan, where the pandemic started and where a strict lockdown has only recently been lifted.\nLocal officials said early reporting there had been delayed and inaccurate.\nPresident Macron's interview came after a weekend of tension which saw the summoning of the Chinese ambassador to Paris by the French foreign ministry to express disapproval over an article on the Chinese embassy's website that said Western countries had left the elderly to die in care homes.\nChina dismissed the row as a \"misunderstanding\". Government spokesman Zhao Lijian said China had never made any negative comments about how France was coping with the epidemic \"and has no intention of making any\".\nMr Macron was asked if China's authoritarian response to bring the outbreak under control had exposed the weakness of Western democracies, and responded that there was no comparison between open societies and those where truth was suppressed.\n\"Given these differences, the choices made and what China is today, which I respect, let's not be so naive as to say it's been much better at handling this,\" he said. \n\"We don't know. There are clearly things that have happened that we don't know about.\"\nHe said that abandoning freedoms to fight the pandemic would threaten Western democracies.\n\"We can't accept that. You can't abandon your fundamental DNA on the grounds that there is a health crisis.\"\nMany Western officials are coming under pressure to explain why the coronavirus outbreak is wreaking havoc on their populations - proportionally much smaller than China's. \nThe UK and the US have led the charge that China's figures and explanations cannot be trusted.\nUK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told a news conference on Thursday that \"hard questions\" would have be asked about how the outbreak started \"and how it couldn't have been stopped earlier\".\nHe said there would have to be a \"deep dive\" into how the virus was able to spread from China and said it could not be \"business as usual\" after the crisis.\nUS President Donald Trump has also taken a harder line against China.\nOn Wednesday, asked why the US accounted for such a high proportion of the global death toll, he responded: \"Does anybody really believe the numbers of some of these countries?\" he said, naming China. \nHe said the US was also looking into unverified reports that the coronavirus may have emerged from a laboratory in Wuhan rather than in a market in the city.\nFox News in the US, citing unnamed sources, has suggested that the coronavirus accidentally leaked from a Wuhan facility because of lax safety protocols.\nThe Washington Post newspaper has reported information obtained from diplomatic cables. They show that, in 2018, US science diplomats were sent on repeated visits to a Chinese research facility. Officials \nUS intelligence agencies have taken an interest, the Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen Mark Milley said on Tuesday. \n\"We've had a lot of intelligence look at that.

For most of these proposals, firms and consumers should consider the amount of interest which may build up, and balance this against the need for immediate temporary support. \n\"If a payment freeze isn't in the customer's interests, firms should offer an alternative solution, potentially including the waiving of interest and charges or rescheduling the term of the loan.\""}
